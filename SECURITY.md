# Security Policy

Security issues specific to the VisIt code base itself have so far been rare.
The issue label, `security` is used to identify issues which manifest known security vulnerabilities.

Security issues, when discovered, follow the same process as any other bug fixes.
Security issues are triaged and assessed for severity and likelihood.
Work to correct security issues is then scheduled as appropriate.

Though the project has so far not encountered the need to respond with urgency to *severe* security vulnerabilities, should any arise the project will use its current communication mechanisms to alert users.

## Supported Versions

The supported version of VisIt is the *latest* release.
The latest release of VisIt can be found on the [releases](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/releases-as-tables/) page on the VisIt website.

Any security issues requiring immediate updates to VisIt will be made available, at best, only in the *latest* release but might also only be made available in the *next* planned release.
A planned release of VisIt may be accelerated in order to address a security issue.
On very rare occasions, the VisIt project may re-release an already released version solely to address a specific or severe issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Generally, any issues with security implications should be submitted to the project's [GitHub issues](https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/labels/deliberation).
Be sure to attach the `security` label.
