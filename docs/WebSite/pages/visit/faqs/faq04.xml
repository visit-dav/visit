<h2>4. What data file formats can VisIt read?</h2>
<p> VisIt can read over 100 file formats. The table below lists some of the most popular data file formats that VisIt can currently read in and visualize. For a nearly complete list of supported file formats, look at the <a href="http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=File_formats">File formats table at visitusers.org</a>. Each file format is read in by a database reader plug-in that is distributed with VisIt. If you want to use VisIt with your data, you can write your data to a file format that VisIt already understands or you can write your own database reader plug-in. You can find out more about writing compatible files and writing a database reader plug-in in the <a href="content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/GettingDataIntoVisIt2.0.0.pdf" title="GDIV">Getting Data Into VisIt</a> manual. </p>

      <p>VisIt's NetCDF reader plugin supports conventions for the ADAPT, Lodi, and FVCOM simulation codes. If your NetCDF files were not generated with those codes then VisIt's basic NetCDF reader will attempt to expose all 1D, 2D, 3D arrays as variables that VisIt can plot. The basic reader does not permit you to specify coordinates for your mesh nor does it allow more than one time step in a file. If your file's variables are disabled in VisIt's plot menus then you may need to extend VisIt's NetCDF reader to support your code's conventions. </p></td>
