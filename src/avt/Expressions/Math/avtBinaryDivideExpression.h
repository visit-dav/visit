//  Class: avtBinaryDivideExpression
//
//  Purpose:
//      A filter that calculates the quotient of its two inputs
//
//  Programmer: Sean Ahern
//  Creation:   Tue Jun 11 16:23:45 PDT 2002
//
//  Modifications:
//
//    Hank Childs, Thu Feb  5 17:11:06 PST 2004
//    Moved inlined constructor and destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
//
//    Hank Childs, Mon Jan 14 17:58:58 PST 2008
//    Allow constants to be created as singletons.
