#    Created.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 22 16:58:36 PST 2004
#    Added more files to LIBS so we can prebind on MacOS X.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Jan 5 09:25:20 PDT 2005
#    Added -lexpr for MacOS X.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 29 11:35:19 PDT 2005
#    I made it be ser/par for parallel build on MacOS X.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Tue Feb  6 17:04:03 PST 2007
#    Added $(GLEW_LIBS)  
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Tue Feb  6 17:04:03 PST 2007
#    Added $(MESA_LIBS)  
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Thu Jul 26 16:07:56 PDT 2007
#    Added -lplotter_ser for avtColorTables reference
#
#    Gunther H. Weber, Wed Sep 19 16:36:14 PDT 2007
#    Add -lplotter_ser for serial engine and -lplotter_par for
#    parallel engine.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri May  1 08:51:00 PDT 2009
#    -lplotter_ser/par introduced other depencies on the Mac. Plotter itself
#    must depend on some new stuff.
