//  Class: avtWedgeExtractor
//
//  Purpose:
//      Extracts sample points from a wedge.  It assumes that the wedges it has
//      been given are in camera space and does not try to populate points that
//      are not in the cube [-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1].

//    Moved inlined constructor and destructor definitions to .C files
//    because certain compilers have problems with them.
