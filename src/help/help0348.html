<h2><p>Querying over time</h2></p>
<p>Many of VisIt's queries can be executed for every time state in the database used by the queried plot. The results from a query over time is a Curve plot that plots the query results with respect to time. The <b>Query parameters</b> area contains a <b>Time Curve</b> button when the selected query can be plotted over time. Clicking the <b>Time Curve</b> button executes the selected query for each time state in the database used by the plot highlighted in the <b>Plot list</b>. VisIt then creates a new Curve plot in a new vis window and uses the query results versus time as the curve data.</p>
<p>By default, querying over time will force VisIt to execute the selected query on every time state in the relevant database. If you want to restrict the number of time states used when querying over time or if you want to set some general options that also affect how time curves are created, you can set additional options in the <b>Query Over Time Window</b> (see Figure8-7). If you want to open the <b>Query Over Time Window</b>, click on the <b>Query over time option</b> in the <b>Controls</b> menu in VisIt's <b>Main Window</b>.</p>
