<h2><p>Setting the host name</h2></p>
<p>The host name is the name of the computer for which the host profile is created. You can change the host name by typing a new host name into the <b>Remote host name</b> combo box. You can also select an existing host name, if there are any, from the <b>Remote host name</b> combo box. If you provide a host name, you can provide the fully qualified computer name (hostname.domain.net) or just the host name. Some systems require the fully qualified name.</p>
<p>Some clustered systems have one overall host name but also have names for the individual compute nodes that comprise the system. The compute nodes are often named by appending the node number to the host name. For example, if the clustered system is called: <i>cluster</i>, you might be logged into node <i>cluster023</i>. When you launch a remote component, VisIt will not find any host profiles if the host name in the host profiles is: <i>cluster</i>. </p>
<p>To ensure that VisIt correctly matches a computer's node name to one of VisIt's host profiles, you should include host name aliases in the host profile for a clustered system. Host name aliases typically consist of the host name with different wildcard characters appended to it. Three wildcards are supported. The \xd4 ?' wildcard character lets any one character replace it while the \xd4 *' wildcard character lets any character or group of the <b>Host name aliases</b> text field.</p>
