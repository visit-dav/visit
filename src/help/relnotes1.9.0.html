<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.9.0 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The VisIt team released a patch release, <a href="relnotes1.8.1.html">version 1.8.1</a>, to
    fix some critical defects that surfaced in the VisIt 1.8 release. Descriptions of the defects addressed
    by the patch release can be found in the <a href="relnotes1.8.1.html">VisIt 1.8.1 release notes</a>. 
    All version 1.8.1 fixes are included in this release.</li>

    <li>A VisIt wiki site has been set up at www.visitusers.org. The wiki contains contributed user and 
    developer documentation for VisIt. Add to it today! The site also offers a user forum.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.9.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>VisIt's Equivalence Class Function (DDF) ability now has a "Count"
    statistical operator.  This operator simply counts the number of data
    points that lie within a given bin.  This allows for easy generation of
    multidimensional histograms.</li>

    <li>VisIt can now be built with support for the SLIVR volume rendering
    library from SCI, University of Utah. SLIVR provides an advanced
    hardware-accelerated volume renderer and when it is available, the Volume
    plot attributes window provides a "SCI, University of Utah (SLIVR)"
    rendering method.</li>

    <li>VisIt's Annotation Window has been redesigned and enhanced to support
    setting text font, size, and color for database and user information
    as well as for independent 2D and 3D axes. The 2D and 3D tabs now have a
    tab for each axis that allows you to independently set the properties for 
    the titles and labels that comprise the axis.</li>

    <li><p>VisIt's CLI has been enhanced so it supports registration of user-defined
    callback functions for many actions. Callback functions can be associated with
    many state objects, including all plot and operator plugin state objects. This means
    that whenever a state object changes, your callback function will be called and it
    will be passed the value of the state object that caused the update.</p>
    <p>Callback functions can also be installed for many ViewerRPC rpc's, which lets you
    attach custom behavior at a much finer grain. For example, if you register a 
    callback function with the OpenDatabaseRPC RPC then your callback function will
    be called whenever a VisIt client opens a database.</p>
    <p>Callbacks are registered using the RegisterCallback(cbName, callback) function.
    The <i>cbName</i> parameter indicates the name of a valid callback function slot
    name. You can see a list of these by calling the GetCallbackNames() function. The
    <i>callback</i> argument is the name of the callback function that you want to
    be called. The RegisterCallback function can take an optional 3rd argument that
    lets you pass user-defined data to your Python callback function when VisIt
    calls your callback function.</p>
    </li>

    <li>A new "colorlookup" operator is now available for use in VisIt's
    expressions. This operator maps a scalar variable to a (color) vector
    variable by performing a lookup in one of VisIt's color tables. It can
    be used to "simulate" a Pseudocolor plot by means of a Truecolor plot,
    allowing users to perform several lookups and blend colors using
    expressions. CAVEAT: Unlike in the Pseudocolor plot, interpolation is
    performed AFTER a color table lookup instead of before. As a result,
    VisIt will interpolate colors after the lookup instead of values before
    lookup. </li>

    <li>Visit's Plot List Context Menu has the added option to "Disconnect Plot 
    from the TimeSlider". This functionality allows the user to plot multiple 
    times from a database of related files, by Right-Clicking on the plot(s) in
    the plot list.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Save Movie</b> wizard now displays the <i>command to run
    later</i> in a window that allows you to cut and paste the command to
    run into a command prompt.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Windows</b> menu now features an <b>Unlock
    everything</b> option under the <b>Lock</b> submenu.  The <b>Unlock
    everything</b> option turns off locking for time, tools, and view in
    all visualization windows.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Preferences</b> window now has an option called <b>New
    plots inherit SIL restriction</b>, which allows you to turn off VisIt's
    default behavior of assigning a SIL restriction from a compatible plot
    to new plots when they are created.  If you turn off the <i>inherit</i>
    option, new plots will be created with all of their subsets
    selected.</li>

    <li>VisIt now looks for session files in the current directory by default. There is a preference in the <b>Preferences</b> window to make VisIt look for session files in your .visit directory by default.</li>

    <li>VisIt now automatically saves a crash recovery file every 5 minutes. If VisIt crashes, the next time you run VisIt, you will be prompted as to whether you want to restore the crash recovery session file to return to the last saved state. This crash recovery option can be disabled in the <b>Preferences</b> window.</li>

    <li>VisIt's ZeusMP reader now supports cylindrical coordinates.</li>

    <li>VisIt's Clip operator now has a 'fast' vs. 'accurate' option,
    with 'fast' being the default.</li>

    <li>VisIt's XML tools have been enhanced to support the notion of a code
    generation target (one of the XML tools: xml2atts, xml2java, xml2python, etc.)
    Code generation targets are designated by the "Target:" keyword in the .code 
    file and allow you to embed code destined for generated Java or Python bindings
    directly in the code file.</li>

    <li>VisIt's XMLEdit tool has been improved to support code generation targets.</li>

    <li>VisIt's xml2python code generation tool now better supports nested state objects.</li>

    <li>VisIt's XMLEdit tool has an improved look and feel, including various user-improvements
    such as a new menu option for regenerating plugin code. The new menu option
    opens a dialog that allows you to select which code generators will be run and 
    then it runs them, regenerating your code to incorporate changes that you've made
    to the XML file.</li>

    <li><p>VisIt's CLI now has <i>GetPlotOptions</i> and <i>GetOperatorOptions</i> functions
    that can be used to return the plot attributes for the active plot as well as the
    operator attributes on the i'th operator on the active plot.</p>  
    </li>

    <li>VisIt's Java API has been updated so ViewerProxy is now divided into ViewerState
    and ViewerMethods objects, mirroring the change in the C++ implementation that was
    made several releases ago. In addition, the ViewerMethods class has been annotated
    with JavaDoc comments that facilitate automatic generation of documentation from
    the Java code. The ViewerMethods class is the most important class with respect to
    controlling VisIt's viewer.</li>

    <li>VisIt's source code now contains an example program, <i>/src/viewer/proxy/proxyexample.C</i>,
    which shows how to use VisIt's C++ interface to make a new VisIt client that can
    control VisIt's viewer. More information is online at: 
    http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=CreatingNewClientWithC%2B%2B</li>

    <li>VisIt's GUI has been enhanced so that a scroll view is automatically added
    to tall windows when VisIt is run on short displays. This makes it possible to
    access controls that would otherwise extend beyond the edges of the screen.</li>

    <li>The <i>visit -movie</i> movie generation program will now preferentially
    use the <i>ffmpeg</i> encoder program to encode MPEG movies if ffmpeg
    is installed on your computer. The ffmpeg encoder produces higher quality
    MPEG movies much faster than VisIt's standard MPEG encoder. If you do not
    want VisIt to use ffmpeg to encode MPEG movies then you can provide the
    <i>-noffmpeg</i> command line option when generating your movie at the
    command prompt.</li>

    <li>VisIt's SimV1 database reader plugin can now accept mixed scalar
    data from simulations that implement the <i>GetMixedScalar</i> callback
    function. Note that the <b>Force interface reconstruction</b> option still needs
    to be enabled in the <b>Material Options</b> window for mixed scalars to be
    plotted.</li>
    
    <li>Enhancements were made to allow filters to obtain ghost corrected material 
    information for datasets where VisIt generates ghost zones. This removes the 
    previous restriction preventing ghost zone generation when the <i>matvf</i>
    expression was used.</li>
    
    <li>VisIt now provides a <i>value_for_material</i> expression 
    that gives direct access to per material values for mixed variables. This expression also 
    utilizes ghost corrected material info and will not hinder ghost zone generation.<br>
    Example Usage:
    <ul><li><i>value_for_material(var,1)</i> -- Provides the value of "var" for material 1</li></ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>The "cylindrical_radius" expression now allows a user to specify a cylinder axis.<br>
    Example Use Cases:
    <ul>
        <li><i>cylindrical_radius(mesh)</i> -- Prior use case </li>
        <li><i>cylindrical_radius(mesh,"x")</i></li>
        <li><i>cylindrical_radius(mesh,"y")</i></li>
        <li><i>cylindrical_radius(mesh,"z")</i> --  Same as default</li>
        <li><i>cylindrical_radius(mesh,{x,y,z})</i> -- x,y,z should be numeric constants </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A config file was added for installations at Argonne National Lab.</li>

    <li>The Miranda reader supports a new file version which scales better.</li>

    <li>The Nek reader was improved by adding code to discover domain boundaries, 
    making it scale better, and supporting more options for the parallel format.</li>
    
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.9.0</font></b></p>
<ul>

    <li>VisIt's Simulation database reader now supports materials whose
    material numbers do not begin at zero.  Ranges of material numbers
    where not all numbers are used are also supported now.</li>

    <li>VisIt displays an error message about not being able to read a file
    called "notset" when the GUI is opened from the CLI via the OpenGUI()
    function.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>Save Movie</b> wizard does not come to the front when it
    is activated until the GUI's <b>Main window</b> is clicked on MacOS
    X.</li>

    <li>VisIt's <b>File Open</b> dialog immediately closes when restoring a
    session file with different sources and the sources do not exist on the
    local computer.</li>

    <li>VisIt's Label plot now shows untransformed 3D vector data, even
    when a Slice operator that projects data to 2D is present in the
    pipeline.</li>

    <li>VisIt's viewer can crash when receiving commands from a simulation
    while already communicating with the simulation for other
    operations.</li>

    <li>VisIt's Clip operator no longer generates bad clips when using
    multiple planes.</li>

    <li>VisIt's GUI crashes when the plot menu is activated immediately after
    choosing an engine profile from the Engine Chooser dialog. The crash only
    happened when reading SAMRAI data.</li>

    <li>The CheckForNewStates function no longer works.</li>

    <li>VisIt prints an error message indicating that it cannot open the "notset" 
    database when the OpenGUI() function is called from the CLI in order to start
    the GUI.</li>

    <li>VisIt sometimes has problems registering macro buttons inside of a 
       "visitrc" file.</li>

    <li>The centering of a Pseudocolor Plot no longer wrongly influences query results.</li>

    <li>Performance problems with FLASH AMR files have been resolved.</li>

    <li>Bugs in the CCM reader have been fixed for files that contain only a mesh and 
    files with unusual internal indexing.</li>
