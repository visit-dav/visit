<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.9.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>VisIt's Equivalence Class Function (DDF) ability now has a "Count"
    statistical operator.  This operator simply counts the number of data
    points that lie within a given bin.  This allows for easy generation of
    multidimensional histograms.</li>
    <li>VisIt can now be built with support for the SLIVR volume rendering
    library from SCI, University of Utah. SLIVR provides an advanced
    hardware-accelerated volume renderer and when it is available, the Volume
    plot attributes window provides a "SCI, University of Utah (SLIVR)"
    rendering method.</li>
    <li>A new "colorlookup" operator is now available for use in VisIt's
    expressions. This operator maps a scalar variable to a (color) vector
    variable by performing a lookup in one of VisIt's color tables. It can
    be used to "simulate" a Pseudocolor plot by means of a Truecolor plot,
    allowing users to perform several lookups and blend colors using
    expressions. CAVEAT: Unlike in the Pseudocolor plot, interpolation is
    performed AFTER a color table lookup instead of before. As a result,
    VisIt will interpolate colors after the lookup instead of values before
    lookup. </li>
    <li>Visit's Plot List Context Menu has the added option to "Disconnect Plot 
    from the TimeSlider". This functionality allows the user to plot multiple 
    times from a database of related files, by Right-Clicking on the plot(s) in
    the plot list.</li>
    <li>VisIt's <b>Save Movie</b> wizard now displays the <i>command to run later</i> in a window that allows you to cut and paste the command to run into a command prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.9.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt's Simulation database reader now supports materials whose material numbers do not begin at zero. Ranges of material numbers where not all numbers are used are also supported now.</li>
<li>VisIt displays an error message about not being able to read a file called "notset" when the GUI is opened from the CLI via the OpenGUI() function.</li>
<li>VisIt's <b>Save Movie</b> wizard does not come to the front when it is activated until the GUI's <b>Main window</b> is clicked on MacOS X.</li>
<li>VisIt's <b>File Open</b> dialog immediately closes when restoring a session file with different sources and the sources do not exist on the local computer.</li>
</ul>
