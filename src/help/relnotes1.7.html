<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.7 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The naming of VisIt releases has changed. The previous versioning scheme allowed for features to be added into patch releases (the third digit in the version number). This gave rise to release numbers such as: <i>1.5, 1.5.1, ..., 1.5.5, 1.6</i>. The new versioning paradigm will increment the second number in the version number with each release of VisIt. The third digit in the version number, when present, will represent a bug fix made to an existing released version of the code. Patch releases of VisIt will be compatible with each other in distributed mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.7</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Revolved Surface Area</i> and <i>Revolved Volume</i> queries are now time-enabled</li>
<li>The Elevate operator has a new option to elevate by a "zero" heigh, allowing quick conversion of plots from 2D to 3D.</li>
<li>Added a new database reader for the University of Tennessee's VLI multivariate data server.</li>
<li>VisIt has a new RAW triangle database reader and writer. The RAW format is an ASCII format consisting of triangle definitions where there is one triangle per line and a triangle is defined by 9 space delimited floating point numbers. The RAW format allows mesh geometry to be shared with CAD programs and rendering programs such as Blender and POVRay.</li>
<li>VisIt has a new NETCDF-based reader for CCSM data, which is climate data. The reader exposes 2D and 3D time-varying mesh data and also provides an alternate representation of the data mapped onto a globe.</li>
<li>Added a new HDF5-based reader for the fusion code, M3D. The reader exposes the full mesh, and each plane in both 2D and 3D. </li>
<li>A new '-diffsum' option was added to VisIt to quickly summarize the differences in two databases and output results in textual form.</li>
<li>Added Claw database plugin that reads Claw format, ascii amr mesh files.</li>
<li>Added ZipWrapper database plugin so VisIt can directly open gzip and bzip compressed databases without having to uncompress
the files before opening them in VisIt.</li>
<li>Improved performance of the DiffSummary() when running VisIt in database differencing mode.</li>
<li>VisIt now has an option to turn on/off automatic creation of <i>Mesh Quality</i> and <i>Time Derivative</i> expressions when the database is read.  This setting is saved in a users's custom settings when <i>Save Settings</i> is used. The default behavior is for this feature to be ON.  The controls are located in the Options->Preferences window.  If this option is changed while a database is open, reopening the database will add/remove the expression variables (corresponding to the on/off condition).</li>
<li>Added support for depth cueing with an arbitrary angle when Scalable Rendering mode is enabled.</li>
<li>You can now create a visual spreadsheet through picking.</li>
<li>The <i>Revolved Surface Area</i> and <i>Revolved Volume</i> queries are now time-enabled</li>

<li>Added support for depth cueing with an arbitrary angle when Scalable Rendering mode is enabled.</li>
<li>If you have a private plugin from an old version of VisIt, VisIt will now successfully ignore that plugin and load the plugin from the new version of VisIt.</li>
<li>Separated the Rendering attributes window into tabs to better support lower desktop resolutions.</li>
<li>Added support for szlib compression library (used in HDF5, HDF4, Silo, and H5Part).</li>
<li>The <i>build_visit</i> GUI have been enhanced to allow interactive selection of most of the command line options available.</li>
<li>The behavior for projecting a slice has been improved.  If a point is explicitly defined to establish the plane, that point will be projected to (0,0).</li>
<li>VisIt now uses the ghost data from Chombo files, rather reproducing the information.</li>
<li>The Python wrappings for the visit_writer module are now installed with VisIt.</li>
<li>The simulation steering window was updated with a new strip chart tab window. This is a postable/unpostable window that allows the simulation writer to monitor up to five simulation variables at a time in separate strip chart windows. The ability to reset
a strip chart was added so
that a user could restart without spurious startup values interfering with the interpretation of the data. The tab labels can be set via the running simulation to identify the variable being plotted. The current value of the data is now displayed in addition to the min and max data. </li>
<li>A custom renderer was implemented for the ParallelAxis plot that, among other things, obviates the need to recalculate the plot when only an Extents slider or axis selector slider is moved.</li>
<li>The Threshold operator was improved to be more forgiving when incomplete attributes are input to it in the CLI.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.7</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problem where preference to 'Try Harder to get Accurate Cycles and Times' was ignored after already having opened a
database once.</li>
<li>Made attempts to match colors read from a database with known color names to be case IN-sensitive. Previous versions would
fail resulting in all black material plots.</li>
<li>Made SAMRAI plugin more mdserver friendly by avoiding building engine-specific objects there.</li>
<li>Fixed failure to read Silo multi-block objects when blocks are in same directory as the multi-block object that points to
them.</li>
<li>Fixed failure to install visitdiff.py when installing VisIt.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with VisIt not honoring the 'Treat All Databases as Time Varying' preference.</li>
<li>Fixed problems with time-locking and hiding/unhiding plots when running VisIt in database differencing mode.</li>
<li>Applying Lineout operator to a plot via the Lineout OpAtts window works again.</li>
<li>Corrected a bug whereby certain Silo files with meshes defined in subdirs would not be sucessfully read by VisIt.</li>
<li>Log scaled views are now rendered correctly in SR mode.</li>
<li>Fixed internal error with <i>Node Pick</i> of data containing ghost nodes.</li> 
<li><i>PickByNode</i> now correctly handles data whose node numbering does not begin at zero.</li> 
<li>Fixed problem with <i>Index Select</i> not correctly handling AMR meshes when the <i>Levels</i> category was chosen.</li>

<li>An index bug with reading SAMI files was fixed.</li>
<li>A pick bug was fixed for degenerate structured grids (e.g. dimensions X by 1 by Z).</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where reference lines were sometimes not placed in the image when doing a SaveWindow.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where the displace operator did not work with 2D Exodus files.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where manipulating log/log view setting could crash VisIt.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where Chombo patches were sometimes placed in slightly incorrect positions, due to floating point accumulation errors.</li>
