<h2><p>Setting the pick variable</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Pick Window</b> contains a <b>Variables</b> text field that allows you to specify pick variables Most of the time, the value in the text field is the word "default" which tells VisIt to use the plotted variables as the pick variables. You can replace the default pick variable by typing one or more valid variable names, separated by spaces, into the <b>Variables</b> text field. You can also select additional pick variables by selecting a new variable name from the <b>Variables</b> variable button to the left of the <b>Variables</b> text field. When more than one variable is picked, multiple variables appear in the pick information displayed in the information tabs.</p>
