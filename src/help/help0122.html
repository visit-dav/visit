<h2><p>Surface and Wireframe modes</h2></p>
<p>The Surface plot can be drawn in different ways. The default appearance of the Surface plot draws the surface only. Wireframes, which are essentially mesh lines, can also be drawn. You can draw wireframes with or without the surface. To select which parts of the plot are drawn, check the <b>Surface</b> and <b>Wireframe</b> check boxes in the <b>Surface plot attributes window</b>.</p>
