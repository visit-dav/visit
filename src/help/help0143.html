<h2><p>Changing the opacity variable</h2></p>
<p>The variable used to determine opacity does not have to be the plotted variable. Having a different opacity variable than the plotted variable is useful for instances in which you want to determine the opacity using a variable like density while coloring the plot by another variable such as pressure. To change the opacity variable, select a new variable from the <b>Opacity variable</b> variable menu. By default, the plotted variable is used as the opacity variable. This is implied when the <b>Opacity variable</b> variable button contains the word <i>default</i>. Even when "default" is chosen, it is possible to set artificial data limits on the opacity variable by entering new values into the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> text fields.</p>
