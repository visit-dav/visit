<h2><p>Setting line style and line width</h2></p>
<p>Several Curve plots are often drawn in the same visualization window so it is necessary that Curve plots can be distinguished from each other. Fortunately, VisIt provides controls to change the line style and line width so that Curve plots can be told apart. Line style is a pattern used to draw the line and it is solid by default but it can also be dashed, dotted, or dash-dotted. You choose a new line style by making a selection from the <b>Line Style menu</b>. The line width, which determines the boldness of the curve, is set by making a selection from the <b>Line Width menu</b>.</p>
