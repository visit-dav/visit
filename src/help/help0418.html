<h2><p>Lighting Window</h2></p>
<p>You can open the <b>Lighting Window</b> (see Figure9-22) by selecting the <b>Lighting</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Controls</b> menu. The <b>Lighting Window</b> has two modes of operation: edit and preview. When the window is in preview mode, light sources cannot be modified, but they are all visible and illuminate the <b>Lighting Window's</b> test sphere so the cumulative effect of the lights can be observed. When the window is in edit mode, light sources can be modified one at a time. You set light properties using the controls in the <b>Properties</b> panel and you can position lights interactively by moving them around in the lighting panel to the left of the <b>Properties</b> panel.</p>
