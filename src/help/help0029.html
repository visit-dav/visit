<h2><p>Setting the active time step</h2></p>
<p>Time-varying databases are composed of one or more time steps which contain data to be visualized. The active time step is the time step within a time-varying database that VisIt uses to generate plots. The <b>File panel</b> contains a group of animation controls below the <b>Selected files list</b> that allow you to set the active time step used for visualization. The <b>Animation slider</b> and the <b>Animation text field</b> show the active time step. To set the active time step, you can drag the <b>Animation slider</b> and release it when you get to the desired time step, or you can type in a cycle number into the <b>Animation text field</b>. If you type in a cycle number that is not in the database, the active time step will be set to the time step with the closest cycle number to the cycle that was specified. Another method of setting the active time step is to double click a cycle number under the database in the <b>Selected file list</b>.</p>
