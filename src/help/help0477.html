<h2><p>Point Tool</h2></p>
<p>The point tool allows you to position a single point relative to plots that exist in the visualization window. The point tool, shown in Figure11-7, provides one hot point at the tool's origin. Clicking on the hot point and moving the mouse moves the point tool's origin in a plane perpendicular to the screen. Holding down the <i>Shift</i> key before clicking on the hot point moves the point tool's origin along the plot axis that most faces the user. Holding down the <i>Ctrl</i> key moves point tool along the plot axis that points up. The point tool is commonly used to set the origin for the ThreeSlice operator or set the location of a point streamline source for the Streamline plot.</p>
