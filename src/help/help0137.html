<h2><p>Tails on the vector glyph</h2></p>
<p>The length of the tails on the vector glyph are determined by the vector scaling factors that have been enabled. You can also set properties that determine the location and line properties used to draw a vector glyph's tail. First of all, you can set the line style used to draw the vector glyph's tail by choosing a line style from the <b>Line style </b>combo box. You can choose a new line width for the vector glyph's tail by choosing a new line width from the <b>Line width</b> combo box. Finally, you can determine where the origin of the vector is on the vector glyph. The vector origin is a point along the length of the vector that is aligned with the node or cell center where the vector glyph will be drawn. The available options are: Head, Middle, and Tail. You can choose a new Vector origin by clicking on one of the <b>Head</b>, <b>Middle</b>, or <b>Tail</b> radio buttons.</p>
