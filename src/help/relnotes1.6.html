<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.6 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.6</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt's is now more proactive about deleting intermediate copies of datasets. Consequently, VisIt's memory footprint while processing data has been drastically reduced.</li>
<li>VisIt's treatment of rectilinear and curvilinear meshes has been substantially improved so rendering them is faster and uses far less memory. 
Specific improvements include:</li>
<p><ul>
<li>Direct rendering of 2D rectilinear and curvilinear meshes</li>
<li>Facelists of 3D structured meshes produce 6 2D structured meshes</li>
<li>Orthogonal slices of 3D rectilinear meshes produce 2D rectilinear meshes</li>
</ul></p>
<li>
VisIt now includes a Spreadsheet plot. The Spreadsheet plot allows users to select a single domain and "plot" its scalar data in a custom Spreadsheet window provided by the plot. The Spreadsheet window is tied to the plot that created it so you can have N Spreadsheet windows open to look at different domains or variables. The Spreadsheet window shows tabs that each contain a table for a slice through the data (1 table for 2D). It is possible to quickly step through the tabs to see different logical slices of the dataset. The slice is also depicted in the visualization window and the slice moves as you change slices in the Spreadsheet window. The Spreadsheet window contains controls for formatting the precision of the text output, coloring the displayed text using a color table, and switching the slice axis used to display the data. In addition, there are features such as min,max buttons to highlight the cells in the spreadsheet that contain the min,max values. Each Spreadsheet window contains its own menu, which provides options for selecting cells, saving selected cells to a text file, copying selected cells to the clipboard, and summing or averaging selected cells.
</li>
<li>The ParallelAxis plot has a new <i>Context</i> rendering mode that condenses groups of lines into bands colored by the number of lines in each band. The helps to highlight the overall behavior of  multivariate data because it highlights trends in line clustering using color. The individual lines between each axis can still be displayed and are useful when 
restricted (using the Extents tool) and drawn over the context. The ParallelAxis plot's attributes window has been completely redesigned in order to make adding axes and reordering them more intuitive.
</li>
<li>VisIt now provides expressions and queries to identify connected components.</li>
<li>VisIt's viewer component no longer links against Mesa so it avoids symbol conflicts with some Mesa-based Linux graphics drivers. Since symbol conflicts related to Mesa are no longer possible, this class of failures should be eliminated.</li>
<li>Curve plots can now be scaled logarithmically.</li>
<li>It is now possible to set properties for VisIt's plot legends. Most plots create legends. For  plots that create legends, a legend annotation object is also now created. The legend annotation object appears in the list of annotation objects in the Annotation window's Object's tab. When you select a legend annotation object in the Objects tab, the window will change to show the legend properties that can be set, including:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Whether VisIt positions the legend automatically</li>
    <li>Position</li>
    <li>The format string used to display numbers, allowing you to control the number of significant digits</li>
    <li>Font</li>
    <li>Font size</li>
    <li>Font style (bold, italic)</li>
    <li>Font color</li>
    <li>Scale the legend to make it larger or smaller</li>
    <li>Turn off parts of the legend</li>
    <li>Draw an optional bounding box under the legend to distinguish it from plots</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>
<li>VisIt's CLI now provides a <i>GetMetaData</i> function that allows the user to obtain a meta-data object that allows for database introspection. For example, the new meta-data object can be used to create menus for a Python-based user interface or it could be used to compare multiple databases.</li>
<li>VisIt's libsim library, which allows simulations to be used as VisIt compute engines, now provides a 
function called <i>VisItUpdatePlots()</i> to force VisIt to update its plots of simulation data.</li>
<li>VisIt's Histogram plot now includes an option to calculate the histogram based on the number of zones that fall within a bin.</li>
<li>VisIt's support for launching the parallel engine with <i>qsub</i> has been enhanced. VisIt now supports using mpiexec and srun under qsub. In addition, users can specify sublauncher arguments, making it possible to send the right arguments down to different versions of mpiexec.</li>
<li>VisIt's Volume plot now incorporates distance when using the <i>Integrate</i> ray function.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides a database reader for the new Miranda file format.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides a query to determine what a detector at AGEX would see in terms of flux coming from Hohlraum. The query integrates a group of random rays through a 2D, 3D, or RZ dataset and computes the amount of energy escaping in a given direction.  The query needs two variables, defining absorption and emission of energy in each zone, and can handle scalar 
variables or arrays which represent energy groups.</li>
<li>Pick has been enhanced so it outputs coordinates from RZ and ZR meshes in the order that the users expect.</li>
<li>Users can now set the font that VisIt uses for its GUI windows using new controls in the Appearance window.</li>
<li>VisIt's Vector plot now provides an option for creating better-looking vector glyphs that are more suitable for publication. The Vector plot attributes window has also been redesigned.</li>
<li>VisIt's error message when it cannot open a file has been improved so that it is issued only once and indicates the names of the plugins that were used when trying to open the file.</li>
<li>The Python binding for the Volume plot attributes now exposes colors and gaussian control points so they can be scripted. This makes it much easier to design color tables for the Volume plot in Python scripts.</li>
<li>The legend used for VisIt's Boundary plot is now smaller when there is a single boundary.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides an expression that can test symmetry about a point.</li>
<li>The <i>Getting Data Into VisIt</i> manual now includes examples describing how to instrument a parallel Fortran simulation with VisIt's libsim.</li>
<li>Progress reported by queries over time has been improved so it gives a better indication of how long the operation will take.</li>
<li>VisIt's FLASH database reader was enhanced to report accurate time values.</li>
<li>The <i>Try harder to get cycles and times</i> flag in VisIt's Preferences window is now saved to the configuration file.</li>
<li>VisIt's Revolve operator does not revolve the mesh about the correct axis when the mesh is RZ or ZR.</li>
<li>VisIt's ESRI Shapefile database reader plugin has been enhanced to tessellate complex polygons into triangles so the polygons are rendered properly in VisIt. This enhancement greatly improves image quality for files that contain complex shapes such as coastlines.</li>
<li>VisIt's Exodus database reader has been enhanced so it supports reading material names.</li>
<li>VisIt's Streamline plot now provides an <i>auto</i> checkbox for the Box streamline source type that tells VisIt to use the dataset extents as the box extents.</li>
<li>VisIt's Python code generation tools have been enhanced so they can generate Python bindings for embedded AttributeSubject objects.</li>
<li>VisIt's Curve plot legend has been improved so that it takes much less vertical space, allowing VisIt to show legends for many more Curve plots. The line drawn in the Curve plot is also longer than before.</li>
<li>VisIt can now read TSTT files.</li>
<li>VisIt's NETCDF database reader better handles meshes with extra dimensions of 1 and no longer allocates too much memory in those situations.</li>
<li>Performance and memory usage in VisIt's FVCOM database reader have been 
improved.</li>
<li>When 3D texturing is not available, the Volume plot should issue a warning.</li>
<li>VisIt now uses Python 2.5.</li>
</ul>
