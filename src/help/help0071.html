<h2><p>Setting the histogram calculation method</h2></p>
<p>When the Histogram plot groups data values into bins, it weights the data value by the surface area or revolved volume of the cell so contributions from different sizes of cells are compared fairly. To change the calculation method used to weight the cells, click on the <b>Area</b> radio button to make VisIt use surface area or click on the <b>Revolved volume</b> radio button to make VisIt use the revolved volume of a 2D cell as the weighting multiplier used to group cells into the right bins.</p>
