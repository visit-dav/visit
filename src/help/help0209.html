<h2><p>Using Resample with CSG meshes</h2></p>
<p>Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling is a method whereby complex models are built by adding and subtracting primitive objects such as spheres, cubes, cones, etc. When you plot a CSG mesh in VisIt, VisIt resamples the CSG mesh into discrete cells that can be processed as an unstructured mesh and plotted. The Resample operator can be used to tell VisIt the granularity at which the CSG mesh should be sampled, overriding the CSG mesh's default sampling. Naturally, higher numbers of samples in the Resample operator produce a more faithful representation of the original CSG mesh. Figure4-45 depicts a CSG model that contains a disc within a smooth ring. Note that as the number of samples in the Resample operator increases, the model becomes smoother and jagged edges start to disappear.</p>
