<h2><p>Setting the timeout</h2></p>
<p>The compute engine and database server have a timeout mechanism that causes them to exit if no requests have been made of them for a certain period of time so they do not run indefinitely if their connection to VisIt's viewer is severed. You can set this period of time, or timeout, by typing in a new number of minutes into the <b>Timeout</b> text field. You can also increase or decrease the timeout by clicking on the up and down arrows next to the <b>Timeout</b> text field.</p>
