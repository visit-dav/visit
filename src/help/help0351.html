<h2><p>Setting the time curve's destination window</h2></p>
<p>When VisIt creates a Curve plot using the results of a query over time, the Curve plot is placed in a vis window designated for Curve plots. If there is no vis window into which the Curve plot can be added, VisIt creates a new vis window to contain the Curve plot. If you want VisIt to always place the new Curve plot in a specific window, turn off the <b>Use 1st unused window or create new one</b> check box and enter a new window number into the <b></b> text field. After setting these options, subsequent Curve plots created by querying over time will be added to the specified vis window.</p>
