<h2><p>Removing operators</h2></p>
<p>You do not remove operators by clicking the <b>Delete</b> button as you do with plots. There are two ways that you can delete an operator from a plot. As its last two options, the <b>Operators</b> menu has options that remove one or more operators. To remove only the last applied operator, select the <b>Remove last</b> option from the <b>Operators</b> menu. To remove all operators applied to a plot, select the <b>Remove all</b> option from the <b>Operators</b> menu. Unless the <b>Apply operator to all plots</b> check box is checked, operators are only removed from selected plots. If you remove operators using the controls in the <b>Operators</b> menu, the plots that are in the completed state are immediately recalculated by the compute engine and redisplayed using the modified list of operators.</p>
<p>The controls in the <b>Operators</b> menu allow you to remove operators from the end of a plot's operator list or remove all of a plot's operators. VisIt also provides controls that let you remove specific operators from the middle of a plot's operator list. First expand the plot list entry by clicking its <b>Expand</b> button and then click on the red <b>X</b> button next to the operator that you want to delete. The red <b>X</b> button deletes the operator to which it is attached. When an operator is deleted using the red <b>X</b> buttons, the plot is reset back to the new state so you must click the <b>Draw</b> button to tell VisIt to regenerate the plot. See Figure4-6 for an example of deleting an operator from the middle of a plot's operator list.</p>
