<h2><p>Opening a time-varying database</h2></p>
<p>A time-varying database (a ".visit" file or virtual database) is opened the same way as a database with a single time step. A time varying database is created by either grouping files into a ".visit" file in the <b>File Selection Window</b> or by turning on automatic file grouping so VisIt creates virtual databases, which are databases made up of multiple single time step databases that have similar filenames. To open a time-varying database, click on it to highlight it and then click the <b>Open</b> button in the <b>File panel</b>. Double-clicking the time-varying database also will open it. The one difference between opening a single time step database and a time-varying database is that if the time-varying database is also a virtual database then it can be opened at a later time step without having to first open it at the first time step.</p>
<p>The <b>File panel</b> displays time varying databases with a green database icon next to the name of the database. There often is also a small check box next to the database icon that expands to show the database's time steps. This is shown in Figure2-8. When a time- varying database is open, the animation controls are activated so any time step in the database can be used. Note that the animation controls are only active when visualizing a time-varying database or when VisIt is in keyframe animation mode.</p>
