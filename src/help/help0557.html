<h2><p>Copying plots on first reference</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's predecessor, MeshTV, copies plots to a new vis window when you set the active window if the new active window has never been accessed. Several VisIt users expressed a desire to have this functionality in VisIt so VisIt now has a <b>Clone windows on first reference</b> option in the <b>Preferences Window</b> that clones all attributes of the active window to a new window when you set the active window to a window that has never been referenced. If you don't want plots, etc to be copied to a vis window that you have not yet accessed when you make it the active vis window, be sure to turn off the <b>Clone windows on first reference</b> check box in the <b>Preferences window</b> before setting the active window.</p>
