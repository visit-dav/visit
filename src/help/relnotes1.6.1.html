<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.6.1 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.6.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt can now read a <i>"visitrc"</i> file at startup for the purpose of Python scripted initialization. The <i>"visitrc"</i> file is a Python script located in <i>~/.visit</i> on most platforms and, if present, it is executed when VisIt starts so users can set up visualizations using Python scripting. Users may also define Python functions and register those functions as macros in VisIt's new <i>Macros window</i> by using the new <i>RegisterMacro(buttonname, function)</i> function in the CLI. When a Python function is registered as a macro using the RegisterMacro() function, VisIt places a button in the Macros window (available from the Controls->Macro menu option). When the user clicks a button in the Macro window, VisIt executes that macro's corresponding user-defined Python function.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>Host Profiles</i> window has been modified so that pressing <i>Enter</i> in text fields in order to get changes to apply is no longer necessary. This makes editing multiple profiles much easier without having to click the Apply button as frequently. The window has also been reorganized somewhat so that the <i>Hardware acceleration</i> tab has been moved into the <i>Advanced options</i> tab along with the networking settings.</li>
<li>VisIt now has <i>color()</i> and <i>color4()</i> expressions that can be used to create color vectors that can be plotted with the Truecolor plot. The <i>color()</i> expression accepts 3 scalars, representing red, green, and blue color channels. The scalars should in the range [0,255]. The <i>color4()</i> expression operates like the <i>color()</i> expression except that it also accepts a fourth scalar for alpha transparency. These expressions allow plotting of multivariate data using colors.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides an <i>atan2()</i> expression.</li>
<li>VisIt's Truecolor plot has been enhanced so that it can plot data from vector tuples with 2, 3, or the desired 4 components. This makes it easier to use the Truecolor plot on regular vector data, in addition to color data produced by the <i>color()</i> and <i>color4()</i> expressions.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides an <i>Argv()</i> function in the CLI to return all VisIt command line arguments that occur after the <i>-s file.py</i> command line argument. The <i>Argv()</i> function is intended to make it easier to create scripts that have positional command line arguments.</li>
<li>VisIt's resample operator now supports vectors.</li>
<li>Simulation Steering documentation was update to include the strip chart and message windows for Simulation steering use.</li>
<li>A Nek3D reader was added for Argonne National Lab.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides <i>Save As</i> buttons in both the <i>Query</i> and <i>Pick</i> dialog boxes. These will save the query & pick data to a user specified file.</li>
<li>VisIt now provides a tensor contraction expression <i>contraction</i> and a viscous stress tensor expression <i>viscous_stress</i> for structured grids with quad zones.</li>
<li>VisIt's database info annotations now have path expansion options.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.6.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt's Spreadsheet plot window can be several times the monitor width when using the MacOS X version of VisIt. This happens when slicing a 3D dataset that produces a large number of tabs to show the slices.</li>
<li>VisIt's File Selection window is completely disabled when VisIt is started from the CLI using the <i>OpenGUI()</i> function.</li>
<li>When VisIt's GUI is launched from the CLI using the <i>OpenGUI()</i> function, the Splashscreen window can require the user to move the mouse cursor around in it in order for VisIt to completely initialize.</li>
<li>The Label plot can draw labels whose exponents are truncated if the values are negative.</li>
<li>VisIt's Mili database reader plugin produces meshes with one node at the wrong location.</li>
<li>VisIt's GUI can crash when using the Save Movie wizard if a user's config file was saved with versions of VisIt from before version 1.5.5.</li>
<li>VisIt's command recording feature sets operator options before an operator has been added, making the recorded script invalid.</li>
<li>The <i>VisItExecuteCommands()</i> function from VisIt's libsim library is used to cause VisIt's viewer to execute Python commands for a simulation, allowing it to set up its visualizations. However, if a CLI is not already running then the commands are not executed. VisIt now launches a CLI if needed.</li>
<li>VisIt's <i>specmf</i> expression has an argument parsing flaw that prevents its fourth argument from ever working.</li>
<li>VisIt's command recording feature does not produce valid code for lighting attributes.</li>
<li>The File Panel in VisIt's Main window does not show the open database when VisIt's GUI is launched from the CLI using the <i>OpenGUI()</i> function.</li>
<li>VisIt's command recording feature mistakenly reports rendering attributes instead of material attributes, leading to invalid code.</li>
<li>VisIt's Truecolor plot should not use texturing for nodal variables.</li>
<li>VisIt's CLI program ignores the -pid command line argument.</li>
<li>VisIt's launch program does not pass the -quiet flag on to the viewer and other programs.</li>
<li>Calling expression definition functions such as <i>DefineScalarExpression()</i> in the CLI to redefine an expression of the same name does not redefine the expression. It instead mistakenly adds a duplicate expression definition that VisIt ultimately ignores.</li>
<li>Many bugs with exporting databases were fixed.</li>
<li>If you put a command in the View window (e.g. rotx 90) and press Apply, that command will now take effect.</li>
<li>VisIt will no longer hang when opening binary files that have the extension <i>.visit</i>.</li>
<li>VisIt will no longer crash when doing a Streamline plot with a single color.</li>
<li>VisIt will no longer crash when slicing a point mesh that has been resampled onto a grid.</li>
<li>VisIt will now properly ignore ghost data when doing a cross-mesh field evaluation expression.</li>
<li>VisIt will now properly honor multiple light sources with its save window operation.</li>
<li>VisIt's expression language no longer issues an internal warning when combining the <i>curl</i> expression
with other expressions.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected where the legend of a contour plot with three isolevels only displayed two isolevels.</li>
<li>VisIt's interpolation of point meshes onto a rectilinear grid with the Resample operator now produces results
that more heavily weight the proximity of the point.  This makes the results more intuitive.</li>
<li>VisIt no longer places the Y-Axis and Z-Axis labels far away from the bounding box 
when placing 3D annotations.</li>
<li>VisIt will no longer swap the opacity and color variables when doing a volume rendering.</li>
<li>Simulation Qtable widget will now send the value in the row and col in addition to the row and col numbers.</li>
<li>ValueChanged signal is now generated for QTable widgets in custom simulation dialog widgets</li>
<li>The integrate query now correctly computes the area under the curve generated by a histogram plot.</li>
<li>The hohlraum flux query was patched to distribute rays correctly, and enhanced to compute temperature along with flux.</li>
