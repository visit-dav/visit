<h2><p>Setting colors</h2></p>
<p>You can design the color component of the volume transfer function using the controls in the top of the <b>Volume plot attributes window</b>. The controls are similar to the controls for the <b>Color Table Window</b>. There is a color spectrum that has color control points which determine the final look of the color table. Color control points are added and removed using the <b>"+"</b> and <b>"-"</b> buttons. Dragging control points with the mouse moves them and changes their order. Right-clicking on a color control point displays a popup color menu from which a new control point color can be chosen.</p>
