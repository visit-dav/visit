<h2><p>Setting the Curve view</h2></p>
<p>Visualization windows that contain Curve plots use a special type of view known as a curve view. A curve view consists of: viewport, domain, and range. The viewport is the area of the visualization window that will be occupied by the plots and is specified using X and Y values in the range [0,1]. The point (0,0) corresponds to the lower-left corner of the visualization window while the point (1,1) corresponds to the visualization window's upper-right corner. To change the viewport, type new numbers into the <b>Viewport</b> text field on the <b>Curve tab</b> of the <b>View Window</b> (Figure9-29). The minimum and maximum X values should come first, followed by the minimum and maximum Y values.</p>
<p>The domain and range refer to the limits on the X and Y axes. You can set the domain, which is the range of X values that will be displayed in the viewport, by typing new minimum and maximum values into the <b>Domain</b> text field. You should use domain values that use the same dimensions as the Curve plot that will be plotted in the visualization window. You can set the range, which is the range of Y values that will be displayed in the viewport, by typing new values into the <b>Range</b> text field.</p>
