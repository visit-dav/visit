<h2><p>Overview</h2></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to work with databases in VisIt. A database can be either a set of files on disk or a running simulation. You can manage both types of databases using the same VisIt windows. First we'll learn about the <b>File Selection Window</b> which allows databases to be selected and grouped. Next, we'll learn how to open databases for visualization using the <b>File Panel</b> before learning how to examine information about a database using the <b>File Information Window</b>. Finally, we'll learn how to reopen a file and close a database.</p>
