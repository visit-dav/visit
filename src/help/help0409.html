<h2><p>Color table window</h2></p>
<p>You can open VisIt's <b>Color table window</b>, shown in Figure9-19, by selecting the <b>Color table</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Controls</b> menu. The <b>Color table window</b> is vertically separated into two main areas. The top area, or manager portion of the window, allows you to set the active color table as well as create or delete new color tables. The bottom area, or editor portion of the window, allows you to edit color tables by adding, removing, moving, or changing the color of color control points. A color control point is a point with a color that influences how the color table will look.</p>
