<h2><p>Saving and reusing views</h2></p>
<p>Sometimes when analyzing a database, it is useful to be able to toggle between several different views. VisIt allows you to save up to 15 views that you can then use to look at different parts of your visualization. When you navigate to a view that you like, click the <b>Save view</b> icon in the <b>View</b> toolbar or click the <b>Save view</b> option in the <b>Popup menu's View</b> menu to save the view. When you save a view, VisIt adds a new numbered camera icon to the <b>View</b> toolbar and the <b>Popup menu</b>. Clicking on a view icon makes VisIt use the view that is associated with the clicked icon so you have one-click access to all of your saved views. You can preserve the saved views across VisIt sessions if you save your settings. If you want to delete the saved views so you can create different saved views, click the <b>Clear saved views</b> icon next to the <b>Save views</b> icon in the <b>View</b> toolbar.</p>
