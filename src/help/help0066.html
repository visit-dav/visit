<h2><p>Drawing points on the Curve plot</h2></p>
<p>The Curve plot is composed of a set of (X,Y) pairs through which line segments are drawn to form a curve. To make VisIt draw a point glyph at the location of each (X,Y) point, click the <b>Points</b> check box. You can control the size of the points by typing a new point size into the <b>Point size</b> text field.</p>
