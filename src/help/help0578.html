<h2><p>Contents tab</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Contents</b> tab lists all of the online help pages and groups them into related topics which are sometimes organized in tree format. When items are organized into a tree, an entry in the list of help pages often has a book icon next to it indicating that the topic contains other help topics. When an item has a book icon, it can be opened by double-clicking on its title or by clicking the check box to the left of the title. Items that have an icon that looks like a stack of papers contain the actual help content and clicking on them displays the help page in the right half of the <b>Help Window</b>.</p>
