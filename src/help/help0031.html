<h2><p>Reopening a database</h2></p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to begin visualizing simulation data before the simulation has finished writing out data files for all time steps. When you open a database in VisIt and create plots and later want to visualize new time steps that have been generated since you first opened the database, you can reopen the database to force VisIt to get the data for the new time steps. To reopen a database, click the <b>ReOpen</b> button in the <b>File panel</b>. When VisIt reopens a database, it clears the geometry for all plots that used that database and cached information about the database is erased so that when VisIt reopens the database, plots are regenerated using the new data files.</p>
