<h2><p>Saving curves</h2></p>
<p>Once a curve has been generated, it can be saved to a curve file. A curve file is an ASCII text file that contains the X-Y pairs that make up the curve and it is useful for exporting curve data to other curve analysis programs. To save a curve, make sure you first set the active window to the visualization window that contains the curve. Next, save the window using the <i>curve</i> file format. All of the curves in the visualization window are saved to the specified curve file.</p>
