<h2><p>Resizing the box</h2></p>
<p>The Box operator uses an axis aligned box to remove cells from the visualization so the box can be specified as a set of minimum and maximum values for X, Y, and Z. To set the size of the box using the <b>Box operator attributes window</b>, you type new coordinates into the <b>X Minimum, X Maximum, Y Minimum, Y Maximum, Z Minimum, </b>or<b> Z Maximum</b> text fields.</p>
<p>The Box operator can also be resized interactively with VisIt's Box tool (for more information, see the Interactive Tools chapter). If you want to use the Box tool to resize the Box operator's box, first make sure that you've selected the plot that uses the Box operator in the Plot list and then enable the Box tool. When the Box tool appears, it uses the same box as the Box operator. Moving or resizing the Box tool causes the Box operator to also move or be resized and the plots in the visualization window get regenerated with the new box.</p>
