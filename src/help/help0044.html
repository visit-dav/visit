<h2><p>Hiding a plot</h2></p>
<p>When you are visualizing your data, you will often have many different plots in the same visualization window. Sometimes you might want to temporarily hide plots from view to more easily view the other plots in the window. To hide the selected plots, click the <b>Hide/Show</b> button in the <b>Active plots area</b>. When a plot is hidden, its plot list entry is gray and contains the word <i>"hidden"</i> to indicate that the plot is hidden. To show a hidden plot, select the hidden plot and click the <b>Hide/Show</b> button again. Note that plots must exist for the <b>Hide/Show</b> button to be enabled.</p>
