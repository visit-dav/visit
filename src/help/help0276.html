<h2><p>Hiding toolbars</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Popup menu</b> has a <b>Customize</b> menu that lets you customize the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b>. For instance, you can choose to hide all of the toolbars so that they do not take up any of your screen space if you use a small monitor. If you want to hide all toolbars, you can select the <b>Hide toolbars</b> option from the <b>Customize</b> menu. If you want to show the toolbars again, you can click the <b>Show toolbars</b> option in the <b>Customize</b> menu. Note that when you select the <b>Show toolbars </b>option, VisIt only shows the toolbars that were enabled before they were hidden. If you want to enable or disable individual toolbars, you can select from the <b>Toolbars</b> menu under the <b>Customize</b> menu so VisIt only shows the toolbars that you routinely need. Once you tell VisIt which toolbars you want to use, you can save your preferences using the <b>Save settings</b> option in the <b>Main Window's Options</b> menu so that the next time you run VisIt, it only shows the toolbars that you enabled.</p>
