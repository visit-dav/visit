<h2><p>Setting the center of rotation</h2></p>
<p>The center of rotation is the point about which plots are rotated when you set the view. You can type a new center of rotation into the <b>Center</b> text field and click the <b>User defined center of rotation check box</b> if you want to specify your own center of rotation. The center of rotation is, by default, the center of your plots' bounding box. When you zoom in to look at smaller plot features and then you rotate the plot, the far away center of rotation causes the changes to the view to be large. Large view changes when you are zoomed in often make the parts of the plot that you were inspecting go out of the view frustum. If you are zoomed in, you should pick a center of rotation that is close to the surface of the plot that you are inspecting. You can also pick a center of rotation using the <b>Choose center</b> option in the visualization window's <b>Popup menu</b>.</p>
