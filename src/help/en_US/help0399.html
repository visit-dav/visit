<h2><p>Annotation Objects</h2></p>
<p>So far, the annotations that have been described can only have a single instance. To provide more flexibility in the types and numbers of annotations, VisIt allows you to create annotation objects, which are objects that are added to the visualization window to convey information about the visualization. Currently, VisIt supports four types of annotation objects: 2D text objects, time slider objects, 2D line objects, and image objects. All of those types of annotation objects will be described herein. The fourth tab, or <b>Objects</b> tab, in the <b>Annotation Window</b> (Figure9-10) is devoted to managing the list of annotation objects and setting their properties.</p>
<p>The <b>Objects</b> tab in the <b>Annotation Window</b> is divided up into three main areas. The top of the window is split vertically into two areas that let you create new annotation objects and manage the list of annotation objects. The bottom half of the <b>Objects</b> tab displays the controls for setting the attributes of the selected annotation object. Each annotation object provides a separate user interface that is tailored for setting its particular attributes. When you select an annotation in the annotation object list, the appropriate annotation object interface is displayed.</p>
