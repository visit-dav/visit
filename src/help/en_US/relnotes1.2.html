<p align="center"><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.2 Release Notes</font></b></p>
<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important 
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt can be used to save MPEG, QuickTime, or streaming movies by running: visit -movie from the command line and providing the name of a session file that was exported from the GUI.</li>
  <li>VisIt now starts up nearly twice as fast on some platforms.</li>
  <li>You can now save your VisIt session to a session file that can be reloaded later. A session file saves all of VisIt's state so that you can pick up exactly where you left off with the same plots, operators, and GUI settings. Session files are, by default, saved in the ".visit" directory in your home directory. To save your session, choose the "Save session" option from the Main Window's File menu. If you want to restore a previous session, select "Restore session" and select a session file. </li>
  <li>Databases with very large extents are now scaled down to reasonable sizes when they are read in.</li>
  <li>The makemili utility is installed by default when it is available.</li>
  <li>Opening databases is faster in parallel now since only the first process has to read in information from the root file.</li>
  <li>VisIt has a new RemoveCells operator that removes cells from a plot according to a user-specified list of cells that should be removed.</li>
  <li>The Subset plot's legend has been much improved so that it is more readable.</li>
  <li>Queries are now accessible from VisIt's Python CLI.</li>
  <li>Periods are now allows in variable names.</li>
  <li>Config files are more readable.</li>
  <li>Query output now has units if units are available.</li>
  <li>VisIt now checks for new files in a virtual database when the nextframe animation button is clicked on the last frame of an animation.</li>
</ul>
