<h2><p>Setting the tensor scale</h2></p>
<p>The Tensor plot's tensor scale affects how large the ellipsoidal glyphs that represent the tensor are drawn. By default, VisIt computes an automatic scale factor based on the length of the bounding box's diagonal to multiply by the user-specified scale factor. This ensures that the tensors are some reasonable size independent of the size of the mesh. To change the tensor scale, type a new floating point number into the <b>Scale</b> text field and click the <b>Apply</b> button in the <b>Tensor plot attributes window</b>. If you want to turn off automatic scaling so the size of the tensors is soley determined by the scale in the Scale text field, turn off the Auto scale check box. Yet another scaling option for tensors is scaling by magnitude. When the <b>Scale by magnitude</b> check box is checked, the magnitude of the tensor's longest eigenvector is used as a scale factor that is multiplied into the scale determined by the user-specified scale and the automatic scale factor.</p>
