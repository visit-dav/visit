<h2><p>Lighting</h2></p>
<p>Lighting is an important element when producing 3D visualizations because all areas of interest in the visualization should be lit so they can be easily seen. To this end, it is often necessary to have multiple light sources so all of the visualization's important areas are bright enough. VisIt can have up to 8 light colored light sources in order to improve the look of 3D visualizations. Each light source can be positioned and colored using VisIt's <b>Lighting Window</b>. It is also possible to have specular highlights in addition to multiple colored lights. For more information on specular highlights, which can make visualizations appear much more realistic, read about specular lighting in the Preferences chapter.</p>
