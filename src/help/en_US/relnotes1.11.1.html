<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 1.11.1 is primarily a bug fix release to release 1.11.  Look <a href="relnotes1.11.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of bugs fixed in release 1.11.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.11.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A bug was fixed where scalable rendering (the parallel rendering mode) would produce the wrong image under a variety of conditions, including zooming in too far or clipping away part of the data set.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where a slice that lay between two, flat domain boundaries could lead to a double contribution (one from each boundary).  The images from VisIt were basically unaffected, but integrations (Weighted Variable Sums) and 2D area queries were double counting.</li>
<li>The host profiles for LLNL's juno system have been corrected to handle node names with 4 digits.</li>
<li>The source code was modified so that VisIt would compile with the gcc 4.3.x compilers.</li>
<li>The help files have been made available once again for the windows platform.</li>
</ul>
