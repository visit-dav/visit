<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 2.4.2 is primarily a
bug fix release to release 2.4.1. It fixes additional bugs in release
2.4.1.  Look <a href="relnotes2.4.1.html">here</a> to see a complete
list of changes in release 2.4.1.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.4.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Material selection now works correctly with AMR data sets when changing time steps.</li>
<li>A bug in the caluclation of the Pick ray was fixed.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed with sizing lines and seeds for the Streamline plot with 2D data sets.</li>
<li>VisIt failed to save regular grids to Wavefront OBJ files.</li>
<li>A memory leak was fixed in VisIt's GMV reader.</li>
<li>The GMV reader caused the metadata server to crash on some versions of Windows when reading certain GMV files composed of multiple smaller files.</li>
<li>An angle conversion in the Cylinder operator was fixed so the operator works again.</li>
<li>Axis titles and text annotations and sometimes are truncated when drawn.</li>
<li>VisIt's rendering performance when displaying back from the RZ to local machines is very slow compared to VisIt 2.3.0.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.4.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>visit -movie</i> script has been enhanced to support a <i>-source</i> command line argument that lets you specify alternate data sources for the files in a session file given by the <i>-sessionfile</i> argument. You pass <i>-source</i> followed by the name of a file that will serve as a replacement file for the one in the session file. When a session file contains multiple sources then you may pass multiple <i>-source</i> arguments to build up a list of sources to be used as replacements. You can use this feature to replace the data files in your session file with other files, thus using it as a template for related visualizations.</li>
<li>The <i>visit -movie</i> script has been enhanced to support a <i>-adjustview</i> command line argument that resets the view for session-based movies, but preserving the view normal and up vector. This argument is meant to be passed when replacing sources with the <i>-source</i> argument since it can adjust the view to be more suitable to the new datasets' spatial extents.</li>
<li>The <i>build_visit</i> script was enhanced so that it is possible to enable and disable Ice-T in the graphical interface. The control is listed as the last entry on the "Select 3rd party libraries" screen. It is on by default when building a parallel version and off by default otherwise.</li>
<li>The <i>build_visit</i> script was modified so that it now builds VisIt without Mangled Mesa support unless explicitly enabled or if building a parallel version. This allows VisIt to run on systems were there are conflicts between VisIt's version of Mesa and the graphics drivers on those systems. The conflicts occured when the drivers were based on Mesa (typically on Ubuntu systems).</li>
<li>A number of improvements were made to the handling of variables restricted to specific materials. These include:
  <ul>
    <li>If you have <i>Apply subset selections to all plots</i> set and you add a  plot, it doesn't apply the subset selection from a compatible plot unless both plots are restricted to the same materials.</li>
    <li>If you replace the database, it only applies the subset selection from a compatible plot to plots that don't contain material restricted variables.</li>
    <li>If you overlay another database, it only applies the subset selection from a compatible plot to plots that don't contain material restricted variables./li>
    <li>If you have <i>Apply subset selections to all plots</i> set and you change the subset selection, it doesn't apply the subset selection to any non-active plots that contain material restricted variables.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
