<h2><p>Projecting the slice to 2D</h2></p>
<p>The Cone operator usually flattens sliced plots to 2D along the cone's direction vector. This results in circular 2D plots in the visualization window. The Cone operator can also unfold sliced plots into a cylinder and then into rectangular 2D plots. Alternatively, the Cone operator can leave the sliced plots in 3D space where their cone shape is obvious. To set the cone projection mode, click on one of the following radio buttons: <b>In 3D</b>, <b>Project to 2D</b>, or <b>Cylindrical</b>.</p>
