<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 2.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can now animate every Nth time state when animating in the GUI by
      setting the animation increment via the Animation window.
  </li>
  <li>VisIt will now leave plots in the visualization window when interacting
      with tools unless you have enabled "bounding box" mode.</li>
  <li>VisIt's point tool has been enhanced so it shows a small sphere 
      indicating the location of the point. This is helpful when placing the
      point within 3D geometry.</li>
  <li>VisIt's plane tool has been enhanced so it is drawn with shading, which
      provides some depth cues and improves the look of the tool.</li>
  <li>VisIt's legend has been enhanced to allow changing the number of tick marks automatically generated, as well as whether or not the min and max values should be included.  The ability to specify numeric values and associated textual labels has also been added.  There is a 1-1 correspondence between the values and the labels, so specifying empty strings will allow skipping textual labels for particular values.  Values specified outside the min/max range will be ignored.  For correct placement of textual labels, numeric values must be specified, but drawing of values can be turned off.  Label drawing now has 4 modes -- off (None), Values only, Labels only, or Values and Labels.  Default is Values only.</li>
  <li>VisIt's plot list context menu now provides options that let you change the order of plots in the plot list. You can also provide a plot description that lets the plot list display a more informative description of the contents of a plot. This is useful when you need to tell apart many similar plots.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 2.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>When available, the IceT parallel compositor is used by default.  A new
      flag, <TT>-no-icet</TT> was added to explicitly disable IceT.  The old
      flag, <TT>-icet</TT>, was maintained for compatibility reasons.</li>
  <li>Operator plugins are now grouped into categories by default and this causes
      operators to be grouped instead of remaining in a flat, alphabetical list. Operators
      each have a default category to which they like to belong. You may edit the
      operator categories in the Plugin Manager window's Operators tab. Double-click
      the operator category and type in a new name. When you click the Apply button,
      the gui's operator menus will be changed to fit the new customized organization.
      If you do not want operators to be grouped into submenus, simply remove the 
      category name for each operator using the "Clear category for all operators" button
      in the Plugin Manager window. Any customizations are saved when you save your settings.

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 2.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's PDB reader now supports "streak plots". A streak plot is a 1D
      slice through an array that is stacked vertically and shown over time
      along the X axis. Streak plots reveal time-varying behavior present in
      the 1D slice as a 2D dataset. Streak plots are mainly for the investigation
      of "history data", which are various arrays stored to the PDB file by
      a simulation's user. Since history data are arbitrary and may not even
      be mesh data, VisIt does not know how to handle them in general. The PDB
      reader allows the user to provide a simple "schema" file that contains
      "streakplot" commands that inform the PDB reader how to slice and assemble
      various history data arrays into streak plot datasets that VisIt can
      visualize. For more information on the streak scheme file, see...(later).
  </li>
  <li>VisIt's Nek reader now serves up per-domain data ranges, which optimizes 
      operations like contouring and thresholding.</li>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 2.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's ray casting volume rendering mode has been overhauled.
  <ul>
    <li>The result is now more accurate, that is more like a true integration.  One nice by-product is that the picture should look substantially the same regardless of the number of samples, where, previously, volumes would get "thicker" when the number of samples increased.</li>
    <li>The samples now "count" for more, meaning that 500 samples per ray is now a "large" number of samples.</li>
    <li>Note that your old transfer functions will no longer produce the same pictures.  
        We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and made the decision to make this 
        interface change because we felt the result was an easier to use and more accurate volume renderer.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The Pseudocolor plot can now correctly restore settings related to glyph types for point meshes, specifically the Sphere glyph type, which was previously not being restored correctly.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where ray casting volume rendering using both kernel based sampling and lighting would produce incorrect pictures.</li>

<ul>
  <li>VisIt's user interface has been ported to Qt4.</li>
  <li>It is now easier to integrate IceT into VisIt, in terms of build_visit and
      CMake.  Testing showed that this library made a substantial speedup with
      parallel rendering and is worth the compile-time effort.</li>
