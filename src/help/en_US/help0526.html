<h2><p>Load balancing</h2></p>
<p>Load balancing refers to how well tasks are distributed among computer processors. The goal is to make each computer processor have roughly the same amount of work so they all finish at the same time. VisIt's compute engine supports two forms of load balancing. The first form is static load balancing where the entire problem is distributed among processors and that distribution of work never changes. The second form of load balancing is dynamic load balancing. In dynamic load balancing, the work is redistributed as needed each time work is done. Idle processors independently ask for work until the entire task is complete. VisIt allows you to specify the form of load balancing that you want to use. You can choose to use static or dynamic load balancing by clicking the <b>Static</b> or <b>Dynamic</b> radio buttons. There is also a default setting that uses the most appropriate form of load balancing.</p>
