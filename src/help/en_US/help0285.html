<h2><p>Locking views</h2></p>
<p>The vis window can lock its view to other vis windows. When this toggle is set, making a change that affects the view in the active vis window will cause other vis windows that have the lock views toggle set to receive the same view as the active window. To lock the view, select the <b>Lock view</b> option from the <b>Popup menu's</b> <b>View</b> menu (see Figure6-12) or click on the <b>Lock view icon</b> in the <b>Toolbar</b>. Note that you can lock 2D and 3D windows separately.</p>
