<h2><p>The Popup menu and the Toolbar</h2></p>
<p>Each vis window contains a <b>Popup menu</b> and a <b>Toolbar</b>, which can be used to perform several categories of operations such as window management, setting the window mode, activating tools, manipulating the view, or playing animations. Options in the <b>Popup menu</b> exist in the <b>Toolbar</b> and vice-versa. A group of actions that is represented in the <b>Popup menu</b> as a menu usually maps to a toolbar in the vis window's <b>Toolbar</b>. To perform an action using the <b>Toolbar</b>, you can just click on its buttons. Access the <b>Popup menu</b> by pressing the right mouse button in the vis window. Select the desired item, then release the mouse button.</p>
