<h2><p>Engine Option Window</h2></p>
<p>You can use <b>Engine Option Window</b>, shown in Figure13-7, to pick a host profile to use when there are multiple host profiles for a computer or if there are any parallel host profiles. When there is a single serial host profile or no host profiles, the window is not activated when VisIt launches a compute engine. The window's primary purpose is to select a host profile and set some parallel options such as the number of processors. This window is provided as a convenience so host profiles do not have to be modified each time you want to launch a parallel engine is run with a different number of processors.</p>
<p>The <b>Engine Option Window</b> has a list of host profiles from which to choose. The active profile for the host is selected by default though the another can be profile used instead. Once a host profile is selected, the parallel options such as the number of processors/nodes, processor count, can be changed to fine-tune how the compute engine is launched. After making any changes, click the window's <b>OK</b> button to launch the compute engine. Clicking the <b>Cancel</b> button prevents the compute engine from being launched.</p>
