<h2><p>Positioning the slice plane using the Plane Tool</h2></p>
<p>You can also position the slice plane using VisIt's interactive plane tool. The plane tool, which is available in the visualization window's popup menu, allows you to position a slice plane interactively using the mouse. The plane tool is an object in the visualization window that can be moved and rotated. When the plane tool is changed, it gives its new slice plane to the Slice operator if the operator is set to accept information interactively. To make sure that the Slice operator can accept a new slice plane from the plane tool, check the <b>Interactive</b> check box in the <b>Slice operator attributes window</b>. For more information about the plane tool, read the Interactive Tools chapter.</p>
