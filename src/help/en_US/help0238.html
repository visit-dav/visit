<h2><p>Setting the file type</h2></p>
<p>You set the file type by making a selection from the <b>File type </b>menu. You can choose from image file types or geometry file types. Note that some areas of the <b>Save Window</b> become enabled for certain file types.</p>
<p>Choosing <i>JPEG</i> format files enables the <b>Quality </b>slider and the <b>Progressive </b>check box. These controls allow you to specify the desired degree of quality in the resulting JPEG images. A lower quality setting results in blockier images that fit into smaller files. The progressive setting stores the <i>JPEG</i> images in such a way that they progressively refine as they are downloaded and displayed by Web browsers.</p>
<p>Choosing <i>TIFF</i> format files enables the <b>Compression type</b> combo box. The available compression types are: None, PackBits, JPEG, and Deflate. When compression is enabled for TIFF files, they are smaller than they would be without compression.</p>
<p>Choosing <i>STL</i> or <i>VTK</i> file formats saves visualizations as geometry files instead of images and also enables the <b>Binary </b>check box. The <b>Binary </b>check box tells these formats to write their geometry data as binary data files instead of human-readable ASCII text files. In general, files written with the binary option are smaller and faster to load than their non-binary counterparts.</p>
