<h2><p>Deleting an expression</h2></p>
<p>You can delete an expression by clicking on it in the <b>Expression list</b> and then clicking on the <b>Delete</b> button. Deleting an expression removes it from the list of defined expressions and will cause unresolved references for any other expression that uses the deleted expression. If a plot uses an expression with unresolved references, VisIt will not be able to generate it until you resolve the reference or change the active plot variable.</p>
