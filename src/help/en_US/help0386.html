<h2><p>Setting axis titles and units</h2></p>
<p>The axis titles are the names that are drawn along each axis, indicating the meaning of the values shown along the axis. Normally, the names used for the axis titles come from the database being plotted so the axis titles are relevant for the displayed plots. Many of VisIt's database readers plugins read file formats that have no support for storing axis titles so VisIt uses default values such as: "X-Axis", "Y-Axis". VisIt's <b>Annotation Window</b> provides options that allow you to override the defaults or the axis titles that come from the file. If you want to override the axis titles that VisIt uses for 2D visualizations, turn on the <b>Set X-Axis title</b> or <b>Set Y-Axis title</b> check boxes on the <b>Title and Labels</b> sub-tab (see Figure9-4) on the <b>Annotation Window's 2D Options tab</b>. Next, type the new axis titles into the adjacent text fields.</p>
<p>On addition to overriding the names of the axis titles, you can also override the units that are displayed next to the axis titles. Units are displayed only when they are available in the file format and like axis titles, they are not always stored in the file being plotted. If you want to specify units for the axes, turn on the <b>Set X-Axis units</b> or <b>Set Y-Axis units</b> check boxes and type new units into the adjacent text fields.</p>
