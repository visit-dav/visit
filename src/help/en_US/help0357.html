<h2><p>Turning off incident nodes and cells in pick output</h2></p>
<p>When VisIt performs a pick, the default behavior is to show a lot of information about the cell or node that was picked. This information usually includes the nodes or cells that were incident to the node or cell that was picked. The incident nodes and cells are included to give more information about the neighborhood occupied by the cell or node. If you want to turn off incident nodes and cells in the pick output, click off the <b>Display incident nodes/zones</b> check box.</p>
