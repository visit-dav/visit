<h2><p>Closing a database</h2></p>
<p>VisIt allows you to close a database that has been previously opened by selecting a database from the list of databases in the <b>Close file</b> menu, which is an option in the <b>Advanced file options</b> menu. Only databases that are not used by any plots can be closed. If you attempt to close a database that is being used by at least one plot, VisIt will issue an error message. The <b>Close file</b> menu is disabled if there are no open databases.</p>
