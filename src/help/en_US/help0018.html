<h2><p>Changing filters</h2></p>
<p>A filter is a pattern that is applied to the files in the <b>File list</b> to determine whether or not they should show up in the list. This mechanism allows the user to exclude many files from the list based on a naming convention, which is useful since VisIt's data files often share some part of their names.</p>
<p>The <b>Filter</b> text field controls the filter used to display files in the file list. Changing the filter will often change the <b>File list</b> as files are shown or hidden. The <b>Filter</b> text field accepts standard UNIX<sup>TM</sup> C-Shell pattern matching, where, for example, a "*" matches filter ("*") shows all files in the <b>File list</b>. Note that you can specify more than one filter provided you separate them with a space.</p>
