<h2><p>Exporting databases</h2></p>
<p>Plot geometry can be saved to a handful of geometric formats by saving the plots in the window to a format such as VTK. Often saving the plot geometry, which only consists of the visible faces required to draw the plot, is not enough. When interfacing VisIt to other tools you may want to save out the database that you've plotted in a different file format. For instance, you might plot a 3D database and want to export actual 3D cells for the entire database instead of just the externally visible geometry. You might also want to save out additional variables that you did not plot. VisIt allows this kind of data export via the <b>Export Database Window</b>, shown in Figure5-9.</p>
<p>You can find the <b>Export Database Window</b> in the <b>Main Window's Files</b> menu. To save a database, you must first have opened a database and created a plot. Note that the data transformations applied by plots or operators will affect the data that you export. This allows you to alter the data using sophisticated chains of operators before you export it for use in another tool. </p>
