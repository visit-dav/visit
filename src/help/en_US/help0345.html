<h2><p>Query types</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's queries can be divided into three types: database queries, point queries, and line queries. Database queries usually calculate information for the database as a whole instead of concentrating on a single zone or node but some Pick-related database queries do concentrate on cells and nodes. Point queries calculate information for a point in the database and several types of variable picking queries fall into this category. Line queries calculate information along a line. Each type of query has different controls in the <b>Query parameters</b> area (see Figure8-6) and as you highlight different queries, the controls in the <b>Query parameters</b> area may change.</p>
<p>Database queries provide a few different interfaces depending on the query. Many database queries require no additional input so they have no controls except for the <b>Query</b> button. Other database queries ask whether the query is to be performed with respect to the original data or the actual data, which is that data that is left in the plot after subsets have been removed and operators have transformed the data. Finally, some database queries ask for a specific domain number and zone or node number.</p>
<p>Point queries provide interfaces in the <b>Query parameters</b> area that allow you to enter a 3D point or a screen space point to use as the point for the query. Line queries provide an interface that lets you specify the start and end positions of the line as well as the number of sample points to consider along the length of the line. Nearly all query types allow you to provide additional variables to query in a <b>Variables</b> text field.</p>
