<h2><p>Setting the number of nodes</h2></p>
<p>The number of nodes refers to the number of compute nodes that you want to reserve for your parallel job. Each compute node typically contains more than one processor (often 2, 4, 16) and the number of nodes required is usually the ceiling of the number of processors divided by the number of processors per node. It is only necessary to set the number of nodes if you want to use fewer processors than the number of processors that exist on a compute node. This option is not available on some computers as it is meant primarily for compute clusters. To set the number of nodes, check the <b>Default number of nodes</b> check box and type a number of processors per node into the <b>Default number of nodes</b> text field.</p>
