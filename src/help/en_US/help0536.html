<h2><p>Setting the number of processors</h2></p>
<p>The number of processors determines how many processors are used by VisIt's compute engine. Generally, a higher number of processors yields higher performance but it depends on the host platform and the database being visualized. The <b>Num procs</b> text field initially contains the number of processors used in the active host profile but you can change it by typing a new number of processors. The number of processors can also be incremented or decremented by clicking the up/down buttons next to the text field.</p>
