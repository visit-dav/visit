<h2><p>Pick mode</h2></p>
<p>You can put the visualization window into one of VisIt's pick modes by selecting <b>Zone Pick</b> or <b>Node Pick</b> from the <b>Popup menu's</b> <b>Mode</b> submenu. After the visualization window is in pick mode, each mouse click causes VisIt to determine the values of selected variables for the zone that contains the picked point or the node closest to the picked point. Each picked point is marked with an alphabetic label which starts at A, cycles through the alphabet and repeats. The pick marker is added to the visualization window to indicate where pick points have been added in the past. To clear pick points from the visualization window, select the <b>Pick points</b> option from the <b>Clear</b> menu in the <b>Main Window's Window menu</b>. The dimension of the plots in the visualization does not matter when using pick mode. Both 2D and 3D plots can be picked for values. However, when using pick mode with 3D plots, only the surface of the plots can be picked for values. If you want to obtain interior values then you should use one of the Pick queries or apply operators that expose the interiors of 3D plots before using pick. An example of the visualization window with pick points is shown in Figure8-8 and an example of node pick and zone pick markers is shown in Figure8-8.</p>
