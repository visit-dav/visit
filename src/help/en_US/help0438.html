<h2><p>View centering</h2></p>
<p>The view can either be based on the original spatial extents of the plot or the actual current extents which are the plot's current extents after it has been subsetted in some way. By default, VisIt bases the view on the plot's original extents which leaves the remaining bits of a plot, after being subsetted, in the same space as the original plot. This makes it easy to see where the remaining pieces of the plot were situated relative to the whole plot but it does not always make best use of the visualization window. To fill up more of the visualization window, you might want to base the view on the actual current extents which you can select by choosing the <b>Actual current extents</b> option from the <b>View based</b> on menu.</p>
