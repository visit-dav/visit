<h2><p>Fullframe mode</h2></p>
<p>Some databases yield plots that are so long and skinny that they leave most of the vis window blank when VisIt displays them. VisIt provides Fullframe mode to stretch the plots so they fill more of the vis window so it is easier to see them. It is worth noting that Fullframe mode does not preserve a 1:1 aspect ratio for the displayed plots because they are stretched in each dimension so they fit better in the vis window. To activate Fullframe mode, click on the <b>Fullframe</b> option in the <b>Popup menu's View</b> menu.</p>
