<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 1.12.1 is primarily a bug fix release to release 1.12.  Look <a href="relnotes1.12.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of bugs fixed in release 1.12.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.12.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The ray-casted volume renderer no longer gets lighting queues wrong when the opacity variable is different than the color variable.</li>
<li>The ray-casted volume renderer no longer gets lighting queues wrong with non-rectilinear and non-AMR data sets.</li>
<li>A bug that sometimes caused the Windows version of VisIt to crash when connecting to a remote computer was fixed.</li>
<li>VisIt's Tecplot writer was enhanced so it can save: 2D meshes, rectilinear meshes, and polygonal meshes. The writer was also changed so it produces files that are easier to read by a human.</li>
<li>VisIt's Tecplot reader now tags meshes as being 1-origin for node numbers. This makes the node numbers show up as 1-origin in the Label plot and in query results.</li>
<li>The paraDIS and paraDIS_tecplot readers were added.</li>
<li>VisIt's Contour plot was enhanced so short line segments are grouped into polylines, which makes setting line styles work better.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected in the XDMF reader, where going through a time sequence a second time could cause read errors.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected in the ZeusMP HDF4 reader, where the mesh in 3D spherical coordinates is read incorrectly.</li>
<li>The CLI was missing the SendSimulationCommand function.</li>
</ul>
