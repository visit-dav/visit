<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. Release 1.12.1 is primarily a bug fix release to release 1.12.  Look <a href="relnotes1.12.0.html">here</a> to see a complete list of bugs fixed in release 1.12.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.12.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The ray-casted volume renderer no longer gets lighting queues wrong when the opacity variable is different than the color variable.</li>
<li>The ray-casted volume renderer no longer gets lighting queues wrong with non-rectilinear and non-AMR data sets.</li>
<li>A bug that sometimes caused the Windows version of VisIt to crash when connecting to a remote computer was fixed.</li>
<li>Projecting slices of vector data on rectilinear meshes to two dimensions now works correctly.</li>
<li>VisIt's Tecplot writer was enhanced so it can save: 2D meshes, rectilinear meshes, and polygonal meshes. The writer was also changed so it produces files that are easier to read by a human.</li>
<li>VisIt's Tecplot reader now tags meshes as being 1-origin for node numbers. This makes the node numbers show up as 1-origin in the Label plot and in query results.</li>
<li>The paraDIS and paraDIS_tecplot readers were added.</li>
<li>VisIt's Contour plot was enhanced so short line segments are grouped into polylines, which makes setting line styles work better.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected in the XDMF reader, where going through a time sequence a second time could cause read errors.</li>
<li>A bug was corrected in the ZeusMP HDF4 reader, where the mesh in 3D spherical coordinates is read incorrectly.</li>
<li>The CLI was missing the SendSimulationCommand function.</li>
<li>The NETCDF reader had trouble reading files with CF convention where mesh coordinates are given using longxy,latixy arrays.</li>
<li>The basic NETCDF reader was unable to read files containing a time dimension. In addition, the basic reader was modified to support using 1-D coordinate arrays, if available, instead of using indices as mesh coordinates. To be used, the coordinate arrays must be 1-D and have the same name as the dimension whose coordinate values they represent.</li>
<li>The Resample operator no longer creates artifacts when resampling AMR data.</li>
<li>The VTK writer (for export database) is now much more efficient in parallel.</li>
<li>The option for TACC systems in visit-install is now better represented in visit-install's help message.</li>
<li>Parallel communication code in the compute engine, which was related to libsim, has been fixed so that libsim once again works with parallel simulations.</li>
