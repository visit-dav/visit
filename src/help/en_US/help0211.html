<h2><p>Slice operator</h2></p>
<p>This operator slices a 3D database with a plane that can have an arbitrary orientation. Plots to which the Slice operator has been applied are turned into 2D planar surfaces that are coplanar with the slice plane. The resulting plot can be left as a 2D slice in 3D space or it can be projected to 2D space where other operations can be done to it. A Pseudocolor plot to which a Slice operator has been applied is shown in Figure4-47.</p>
