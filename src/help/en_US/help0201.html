<h2><p>Setting the Reflect operator attribute window's input mode</h2></p>
<p>The <b>Reflect operator attributes window</b>, shown in Figure4-40, has two input modes. One input mode is for 2D data, in which only reflection quadrants are shown, and the second input mode is for 3D data for which the window shows 3D octants. In either input mode, clicking on the brightly colored shapes turns on different reflections and in the 3D input mode, clicking on the cyan arrow rotates the view so you can more easily get to reflections in the back. To set the input mode, click either the <b>2D</b> or <b>3D</b> radio buttons.</p>
