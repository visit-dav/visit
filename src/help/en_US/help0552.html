<h2><p>Changing GUI Style</h2></p>
<p>VisIt's GUI can adapt its look and feel, or application style, to the platform on which it is running or you can make it use the application style of another computer platform. When VisIt runs on a Windows computer, it looks like a Windows application. When VisIt runs on a computer running some variant of UNIX<sup>TM</sup>, it will often look like a Motif or SGI application. When VisIt runs on MacOS X, its controls are drawn in the same fancy Aqua style that is used by other MacOS X applications.</p>
<p>If you prefer VisIt to use a non-default application style, you can change the application style so VisIt more closely resembles applications that run on your favorite platform. To change application styles, select a new option from the <b>GUI style</b> menu in the <b>Appearance Window</b> and click the <b>Apply</b> button. This will cause all of VisIt's windows to redraw themselves to reflect the style that you chose. The supported styles are: Windows, CDE, Motif, SGI, Platinum, Aqua, and Macintosh. The Aqua and Macintosh styles are only supported on MacOS X. Figure14-3 shows VisIt's <b>Main Window</b> in three common application styles.</p>
