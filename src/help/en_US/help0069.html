<h2><p>Setting the type of graph</h2></p>
<p>The Histogram plot has two mode in which it can appear: curve and block. When the Histogram plot is drawn as a curve, it looks like the Curve plot. When the Histogram plot is drawn in block mode, it is drawn as a bar graph where each bin is plotted along the X-axis and the height of each bar corresponds to the number of values that were assigned to that bin. You can set change the Histogram plot's appearance by clicking the <b>Curve</b> or <b>Block</b> radio buttons.</p>
