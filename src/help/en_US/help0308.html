<h2><p>Locking views</h2></p>
<p>If you have created plots from related databases in multiple visualization windows, you can lock the views for the visualization windows together so as you change the view in one of the visualization windows with a locked view, the other visualization windows with locked views also update to have the same view. There are three types of views in VisIt: curve, 2D, and 3D. If you have 2D plots in a visualization window, the visualization window is considered to be 2D. Locking that 2D visualization window's view will only update other visualization windows that are also 2D and vice-versa. The same is true for curve and 3D views. To lock a visualization window's view, select the <b>Lock-&gt;View</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Window</b> menu or use the visualization menu's <b>Popup menu</b> or <b>Toolbar</b>.</p>
