<h2><p>Using the Subset Window</h2></p>
<p>You can open the <b>Subset Window</b>, shown in Figure7-2, by clicking on the <b>Subset</b> option in the <b>Main Window's Controls</b> menu or by clicking on the <b>Subset</b> icon next to the name of a plot in the <b>Plot lists's</b> plot entries. VisIt's <b>Subset Window</b> displays subset relations and provides controls that allow you to alter a plot's SIL restriction by turning off parts of the database.</p>
<p>The <b>Subset Window</b> initially has three panels that display the sets contained in a database though the window can display an unlimited number of panels as subsets are browsed. Each successive panel serves to further subset the database. The leftmost panel contains the top level set for the database being examined. The top level set, which includes all elements in the database, can usually be decomposed in various ways. For example, it can be decomposed by material, processor domain, etc. The various ways in which a database can be decomposed are called subset categories. The subset categories will vary according to the file format in which the database was written as well as the organization and naming conventions used in the database.</p>
