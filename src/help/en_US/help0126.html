<h2><p>Limits</h2></p>
<p>Setting limits for the plot imposes artificial minima and maxima on the plotted variable. This effectively restricts the range of data used to color and set the height for the Surface plot. You might set limits when you are only interested in a small range of the data or when data limits need to be maintained for multiple time steps, as when playing an animation. Setting limits often highlights a certain range in the data by assigning more colors to that data range.</p>
<p>When setting the limits for the Surface plot, the first option to set is the limit mode. The limit mode determines whether the original data extents are used or the current plot data extents, which may vary, are used. To select the limit mode, choose either <b>Use Original Data</b> or <b>Use Current Plot</b> from the <b>Limits</b> menu.</p>
<p>The limits for the Surface plot consist of a minimum value and a maximum value. You may set these limits, and turn them on and off, independently of one another. That is, the use of one limit does not require the use of the other. To set a limit, check the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> check box next to the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> text field and type a new limit value into the <b>Min</b> or <b>Max</b> text field.</p>
