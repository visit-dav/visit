<h2><p>Query</h2></p>
<p>VisIt allows you to gather quantitative information from the database being visualized through the use of queries. A query is a type of calculation that can either return values from the database or values that are calculated from data in the database. For example, VisIt's Pick and Lineout capabilities (described later in this chapter) are specialized point and line queries that print out the values of variables in the database at points or along lines. In addition to point and line queries, VisIt provides database queries that return values that are based on all of the data in a database.</p>
<p>Some queries can even be executed for all of the time states in a database to yield a Curve plot of the query's behavior over time. This feature will be covered in more detail a little later.</p>
<p>VisIt's queries are available in the <b>Query Window</b> (shown in Figure8-5), which you can open by clicking the <b>Query</b> option in the <b>Main Window's Control </b>menu. The <b>Query window</b> consists of upper and lower areas where the upper area allows you to select a query and set its query parameters. The controls for setting a query's parameters change as required and some queries have no parameters and thus have no controls for setting parameters. The bottom area of the window displays the results of the query once VisIt has finished processing it. The results for new queries are appended to the output from previous queries until you clear the <b>Query results</b> by clicking the <b>Clear results</b> button.</p>
