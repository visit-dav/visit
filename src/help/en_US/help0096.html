<h2><p>Changing the point type</h2></p>
<p>The Pseudocolor plot can use five different point types for drawing point meshes (see Figure3-23). The Pseudocolor plot draws an object of the desired point type, scaled by the point size, for each point in a point mesh. Setting the point type has no effect if the plotted mesh is not a point mesh.The different point types are as follows: Box, Axis, Icosahedron, Point, and Sphere. To set the point type choose a new point type from the <b>Point Type</b> combo box.When the point type is set to Box, the Pseudocolor plot draws a small cube for each point in the point mesh. When the point type is set to Axis, the Pseudocolor plot draws there small axis-aligned planes for each point in the point mesh. When the point type is set to Icosahedron, the Pseudocolor plot draws small icosahedra at each point in the point mesh. When the point type is set to Point, the Pseudocolor plot uses flat quadrilateral points. When the point type is set to Sphere, the Pseudocolor plot uses flat quadrilateral points with an applied texture to make them look like spheres. In general, setting the point type to Point will cause the Pseudocolor plot to have the fastest rendering performance.</p>
