<p>VisIt provides a way to interactively pick values from the visualized data using the visualization window's Zone Pick and Node Pick modes. When a visualization window is in one of those pick modes, each mouse click in the visualization window causes VisIt to find the location and values of selected variables at the pick point. When VisIt is in Zone pick mode, it finds the variable values for the zones that you click on. When VisIt is in node pick mode, similar information is returned but instead of returning information about the zone that you clicked on, VisIt returns information about the node closest to the point that you clicked. Pick is an essential tool for performing data analysis because it can extract exact information from the database about a point in the visualization.</p>
