<h2><p>Reflection and Translation</h2></p>
<p>When you visualize multiple related databases, they often occupy the same space in the visualization window since they may have been generated using the same computational mesh but with different physics. When this is the case, you can modify the location of the plots from one of the databases in two immediately obvious ways. First of all, if you simulated the same object and it does not make use of any symmetry then you could use VisIt's Transform operator to translate the coordinate system of one of the plots out of the way of the other plot so you can look at the two plots from the different databases side by side in the same visualization window. If your databases make use of symmetry - maybe you only simulated half of the problem, then you can apply VisIt's Reflect operator to one of the plots to show them side by side but reflected to show the entire problem. Each method has its merits.</p>
