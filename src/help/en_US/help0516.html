<h2><p>Activating a host profile</h2></p>
<p>Only one host profile can be active for any given computer. When VisIt launches a remote component, it looks for the active host profile for the computer where the component is to be launched. To activate a different host profile, click the <b>Active profile for host</b> toggle button in the <b>Selected profile</b> settings. The VCL and the database server use the active host profile but VisIt will prompt you for a host profile to use before launching a compute engine if you have more than one host profile or your only host profile has parallel options set for the compute engine.</p>
