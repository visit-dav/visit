<h2><p>Growing layers</h2></p>
<p>The OnionPeel operator starts with a seed and adds layers of new cells around that seed. The added cells are determined by the layer number and the adjacency information. The cell adjacency rule determines the connectivity between cells. Cells are next to each other if they share a cell face or a cell node. The visualization will differ slightly depending on which adjacency rule is used. To change the adjacency rule, click the <b>Node</b> or the <b>Face</b> radio buttons in the <b>OnionPeel operator attributes window</b>, shown in Figure4-36</p>
<p>The OnionPeel operator initially shows zero layers out from the seed, so only the seed is shown in the visualization when the OnionPeel operator is first applied. Consequently, the visualization might appear to be empty since some seed cells are very small. To add more layers around the seed, enter a larger layer number into the <b>Layer Number</b> text field. Clicking the up or down buttons next to the <b>Layer Number</b> text field also increments or decrements the layer number.</p>
