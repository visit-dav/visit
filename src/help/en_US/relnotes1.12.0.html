<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>

<!--
<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
   <li>The VisIt 1.12 release was made on an abbreviated schedule.  Our project decided to make this release early to 
       catch up to our regular release schedule, which had slipped with the 1.10 release.  We strive to have four major
       releases per year.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Announcements</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The VisIt team released a patch release, <a
    href="relnotes1.12.1.html">version 1.12.1</a>, to fix some critical
    defects that surfaced in the VisIt 1.12 release.  Descriptions of
    the defects addressed by the patch release can be found in the <a
    href="relnotes1.12.1.html">VisIt 1.12.1 release notes</a>.  All
    version 1.12.1 fixes are included in this release.</li>

<a name="General_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can now transform the time shown in the database information and time slider annotations. The new controls for time in the Annotations window allow you to scale time and add an offset.</li>
  <li>New expressions are available that compute hyperbolic sine, consine and tangent.<li>
  <li>You can now execute Ultra (curve plotting software) commands from within VisIt. This is accomplished from the CLI by using the new 'LoadUltra()' command, which will replace VisIt's command prompt with an Ultra prompt, allowing only Ultra commands to be entered. 'end' or 'quit' must be entered to return to VisIt's cli prompt.  Use 'help' at the Ultra prompt for information about currently supported commands.</li>
  <li>The Spreadsheet plot was enhanced so it is now possible to extract rows or columns of data and create Curve plots of the data vs. the X or Y mesh coordinates.  This allows plotting of curves from what is essentially a "logical lineout".</li>
  <li>An option to replace only selected plots was added. It is available from the right click popup menu in the File Panel.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_Features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt can now connect to simulations using SSH tunneling.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VisIt's PDB reader now supports "streak plots". A streak plot is a 1D
      slice through an array that is stacked vertically and shown over time
      along the X axis. Streak plots reveal time-varying behavior present in
      the 1D slice as a 2D dataset. Streak plots are mainly for the investigation
      of "history data", which are various arrays stored to the PDB file by
      a simulation's user. Since history data are arbitrary and may not even
      be mesh data, VisIt does not know how to handle them in general. The PDB
      reader allows the user to provide a simple "schema" file that contains
      "streakplot" commands that inform the PDB reader how to slice and assemble
      various history data arrays into streak plot datasets that VisIt can
      visualize.
  </li>
  <li>VisIt's Pixie reader was fixed so moving meshes work properly.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Silo plugin was enhanced so it can preserve directory
      hierarchies for variables when exporting databases. This means that 
      variables that contain slashes "/" in the names will cause intermediate
      directories to be created, which is most often how those variables 
      acquired the "/" characters.</li>
  <li>VisIt can accept expression definitions from files that it opens.
      VisIt's Silo plugin was enhanced so it saves those expression definitions
      when exporting databases. This permits VisIt to transform an input
      database, export, and still retain the expression definitions from
      the original database.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Dyna3D reader has been enhanced so it is more tolerant of
      variable length material cards and malformed material cards.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Mili reader is now available for the windows platform.</li>
  <li>VisIt's STL reader has been fixed so it no longer crashes on MacOS X.</li>
  <li>VisIt's BOV reader has been enhanced so it supports short integer (16 bit) 
      data. Use the <b>SHORT</b> keyword for the DATA_FORMAT in the BOV header file
      to specify that your BOV file contains short integer data.</li>
  <li>The accepted maximum line length in VisIt's PlainText reader has been
      increased from 4K to 32K characters.</li>
  <li>Added database readers for paraDIS data, and for paraDIS-style tecplot data.  </li>
  <li>VisIt's PDB reader supports another convention.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Silo writer has been enhanced to properly save out ghost zones for
      unstructured meshes as ghost instead of as real zones. This ensures they 
      will be handled correctly when the Silo dataset is read back into VisIt.</li>
  <li>VisIt's VTK reader has been enhanced so it exposes array variables for arrays
      contain many components. If those arrays contain character or unsigned character
      data then VisIt exposes them as label variables.</li>
  <li>VisIt's PATRAN reader now serves up cell-centered variables defined with
      card 4 as scalars that can be plotted. For lack of a better method of
      naming them, they are called: property1, property2, and so on.</li>
  <li>VisIt's MFIX reader was fixed to support multiple time states.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Enzo reader now supports the new packed AMR version of
       this format.</li>
  <li>VisIt now has a LAMMPS reader which supports two of LAMMPS file
       formats: the input format used in the read_data command,
       and the output dump format of several variants.</li>
  <li>VisIt's XYZ file format now supports Exporting data.</li>
  <li>The XYZ file format reader now supports both atomic numbers and atomic
       symbols in the first column, it now allows differing numbers of
       atoms in each time step, and it also now supports the CrystalMaker
       variant of the format.</li>
  <li>VisIt's PFLOTRAN reader now supports the most current variant of the format.
       Note that variable centering has changed; this improves support for the
       old format as well, but turns off automatic domain decomposition for this
       old format.  It also works around a bug in some HDF5 implementations which
       caused problems when reading integer data.</li>
  <li>Added a reader for PlasmaState monitor files.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Poincar&eacute; plot has been added, which supports topological analysis of magnetic fieldlines in fusion codes.</li>
  <li>The Mesh plot now supports transulcent mesh lines.</li>
  <li>The Parallel Coordinates plot now supports a graduated color scheme
       for focus rendering, similar to the way the context is rendered.</li>
  <li>The multidimensional axes, such as the ones used in the Parallel Coordinates
       plot, have been improved with support for scientific notation, correct number
       of significant digits in tick mark labels, and better fonts.</li>
  <li>Subset plots of whole meshes -- a simple way to get a single-color
       lit and shaded plot of an entire dataset -- now work correctly.</li>
  <li>The Parallel Coordinates plot now supports histograms for the context,
       which allows it to function with constant speed when using supported
       formats like FastBit.</li>
  <li>The Parallel Coordinates plot now also supports optionally using histograms
       for the focus instead of plotting all data values.  For a fixed
       display resolution, this is functionally equivalent when using a single
       color focus, but scales to arbitrarily large data sets.</li>
  <li>Streamlines can be colored by a mesh variable.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed the Box operator to work correctly with curves.</li>
  <li>The Revolve operator was fixed so it can once more revolve about a user-defined axis of revolution.</li>
  <li>Fixed Lineout operator's no-sampling mode to enable handling of very small-scale data </li>
  <li>The Replicate operator now has a new feature which allows it to shift
       the origin/extents of a periodic-boundary condition atomic data set.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added hyperbolic versions of sine, cosine and tangent: sinh, cosh, tanh</li>
  <li>Added optional numeric argument for ln and log10 expressions. The value specified will be used in liu of taking ln/log10 of non-positive values and will prevent VisIt from throwing exceptions when non-positive values are encountered.</li>
  <li>Better support for various centering options in expressions, including
       single-cell meshes and other unusual cases.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Various compilation issues were resolved for compiling VisIt on
      Linux-PPC systems.  Thanks to Patrick Shinpaugh for the fixes!</li>
  <li>When using the context menu in the plot list, copying a plot via the
      <i>Copy plot</i> menu option would result in no plots being selected.
      The default behavior has been modified so the new, copied plot is
      made active.</li>
  <li>The Fortran libsim interface could crash the simulation in the event that
      VisIt was unable to connect to the simulation.</li>
  <li>VisIt was not sending expression definitions to the compute engine
      prior to executing a database query. This could cause database queries 
      to fail if the expressions had not already been sent to the compute
      engine for another reason such as for creating a plot.</li>
  <li>VisIt's <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query could crash the parallel compute engine if
      a processor did not have data.</li>
  <li>VisIt's <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query could return all zeroes in the event that
      many of the line segments produced by its line scan were duplicates. This prevented
      the query from linking the line scans into larger connected lines along which
      the <i>Hohlraum Flux</i> query integrates its results.</li>
  <li>VisIt's simulation database reader was not freeing unstructured data.</li>
  <li>VisIt's component launcher program was fixed so users can use "Parse from SSH_CLIENT" in their host profiles when connecting to libsim-instrumented simulations that run on remote computers. That setting would previously cause simulations to crash when VisIt connected to them.</li>
  <li>Fixed log-view scaling so that it works correctly with 2d Contour plots.</li>
  <li>VisIt's Spreadsheet plot now highlights the correct cell for node picks.</li>
  <li>VisIt's can now group files ending in <i>.h5</i> when smart file grouping is used.</li>
  <li>3D Text annotations now are drawn when scalable rendering is used.</li>
  <li>The POV-Ray file writer now correctly writes its generated include files
       (such as color tables, atomic property definitions) to the same directory
       as the rest of the output files.</li>
  <li>Some bugs related to axes and the Parallel Coordinates plot were fixed,
       including a crash, which could occur in unusual circumstances.</li>
  <li>Updated the M3D database reader.</li>
  <li>Made improvements to the AdamsBashforth solver used for streamline calculation.</li>
  <li>Compilation fixes were added for recent GNU compilers.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed which caused small-scale AMR datasets to deadlock when
      operating in parallel.</li>
  <li>Some third party libraries were updated in <TT>build_visit</TT>, mostly
      to work around compilation issues on modern systems.</li>
  <li>A compositing bug involving 'white pixels' was fixed.  For details, see
      <A HREF="https://email.ornl.gov/mailman/htdig/visit-users/2009-March/003152.html"
      >this</A> mailing list thread.</li>
  <li>The IceT compositing code path will now fall back to other compositors
      when transparency is in use, making it 'safe' to leave enabled in all
      cases.</li>
  <li><TT>build_visit</TT> will pause when notifying the user that it cannot
      find required programs for the curses-based interface.</li>
  <li>Fixed a parallel bug with DDFs that caused all processors to unnecessarily write results to disk.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Config_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to configuration files in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 1.12</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>xml2projectfile is now built by default</li>
  <li>VisIt's configure script now provides an --enable-engine-only option that lets you
      build just the compute engine and its plugins. This option is useful when you need to 
      build just a compute engine for a remote server.</li>
  <li>VisIt's configure script now provides an --enable-server-components-only option that
      lets you build only the compute engine, mdserver, vcl, and their plugins.</li>
  <li>VisIt's compute engine was ported to BlueGene/P.</li>
