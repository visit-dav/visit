<h2><p>Keyframing Window</h2></p>
<p>Keyframe animations are designed using VisIt's <b>Keyframing Window</b> (see Figure10-3), which you can open by selecting the <b>Keyframing</b> option from the <b>Main Window's Controls menu</b>. The window is dominated by the <b>Keyframe area</b>, which consists of many vertical lines that correspond to each frame in the animation and horizontal lines, or <b>Keyframe lines</b>, that correspond to the state attributes that are being keyframed. The horizontal lines are the most important because they allow you to move and delete keyframes and set the plot range, which is the set of animation frames over which the plot is defined.</p>
