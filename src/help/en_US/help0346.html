</td>
<td width="12%"><p>DB</p>
</td>
<td width="62%"><p>The Distance From Boundary query calculates how much mass is at a given distance away from the boundary of a shape. An important distinction for this query is that distance from the boundary (for a given point) is not defined as the shortest distance to the boundary, but simultaneously as all surrounding distances. Axially symmetric objects (RZ-meshes) are treated as 3D meshes and length scales are calculated over the revolved, 3D object. The implementation employs a statistical approach, with the casting of uniform density, random lines. The result of this query is a curve, which is outputted as a separate file. This curve contains the amount of mass as a function of length scale. Integrating the curve between P0 and P1 will give the total mass at distance between P0 and P1 (given the interpretation above). The name of the resulting file is printed to the <b>Query results</b>.</p>

The properties of the Lineout operator such as the start and end points are set using the controls in the <b>Query parameters</b> area of the <b>Query Window</b>. Creating Lineouts in this manner instead of using VisIt's interactive lineout allows you to create 1D Curve plots from 3D databases.</p>
