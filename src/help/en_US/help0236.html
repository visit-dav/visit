<h2><p>Picking an output directory for saved files</h2></p>
<p>On most platforms, VisIt's default behavior is to save output files to the current directory, which is the directory where VisIt was started. On the Windows platform, VisIt saves images to the "My images" directory, which is a directory under the VisIt installation directory. If you want to specify a special output directory for your output files, you can turn off the <b>Output files to current directory</b> check box and type in the path to the directory where you want VisIt to save your files in the <b>Output directory</b> text field. If you want to browse the file system to find a suitable directory in which to save your images, click on the <b>"..."</b> button to the right of the <b>Output directory</b> text field to bring up a <b>Directory chooser</b> dialog. Once you select a suitable directory using the <b>Directory chooser</b> dialog, the path that you chose is inserted into the <b>Output directory</b> text field.</p>
