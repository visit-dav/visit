<h2><p>Scale</h2></p>
<p>You can use the Transform operator to scale plots. Each dimension can be scaled independently by entering a new scale factor into the <b>X, Y, Z</b> text fields. Each scale factor is a multiplier so that a value of 1 scales plots to their original size while a value of 2 scales plots to twice their original size. To apply the scale component of the Transform operator, be sure to check the <b>Scale</b> check box in the <b>Transform operator attributes window</b>. All dimensions are scaled relative to a scaling origin which can be changed by typing a new origin into the middle lower <b>Origin</b> text field.</p>
