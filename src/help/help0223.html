<h2><p>Setting the variable range</h2></p>
<p>The Threshold operator uses a range of values to determine which cells from the database should be kept in the visualization. You specify the range of values by lower and upper bounds on the threshold variable. Cells with values below the lower bound or with values above the upper bound are removed from the visualization. To specify a new lower bound, type a new number or the special keyword: <i>min</i> into the <b>Threshold operator attributes window's</b> (Figure4-57) <b>Lower bound</b> text field. To specify a new upper bound, type a new number or the special keyword: <i>max</i> into the <b>Upper bound</b> text field.</p>
<p>When the threshold variable is a nodal quantity, the cell being considered by the Threshold operator has values at each node in the cell. In this case, the Threshold operator provides a control that determines whether or not to keep the cell if some nodes have values in the threshold range or if all nodes have values in the threshold range. More cells are usually removed from the visualization when all nodes must be in the threshold range. Click the <b>Some</b> radio button to allow cells where at least one value is in the threshold range into the visualization. Click the <b>All</b> radio button to require that all nodal values exist in the threshold range.</p>
