<h2><p>Plotting species</h2></p>
<p>VisIt provides the <i>Species</i> scalar variable so you can plot or create expressions that involve species. If you create a Pseudocolor plot of the Species variable, the resulting plot will have a constant value of 1.0 over the entire mesh because when no species have been removed, they all sum to 1.0. Once you begin removing species by turning off species subsets in the <b>Subset Window</b>, the plotted value of Species changes, causing plots that use it to also change. If you remove all but one species, the plots that use the Species variable will show zero for all areas that do not contain the one selected species (see Figure7-14). For example, if you had air for a material and then you removed every species except for oxygen, the plots that use the Species variable would show zero for every place that had no oxygen.</p>
