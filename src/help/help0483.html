<h2><p>Database correlations</h2></p>
<p>A database correlation is a map that relates one or more different time-varying databases so that when accessed with a common time state, the database correlation can tell VisIt which time state to use for any of the databases in the database correlation. Since VisIt supports multiple logical time sliders, so time states can be changed independently for different time-varying databases in the same window, no time slider for any database can have any effect on another database. Sometimes when comparing two different, but related, time-varying databases, it is useful to make plots of both databases and see how they behave over time. Since changing time for each database independently would be tedious, VisIt provides database correlations to simplify visualizing multiple time-varying databases.</p>
