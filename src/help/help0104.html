<h2><p>Setting point properties</h2></p>
<p>The Scatter plot can draw its points in five different styles: Box, Axis, Icosahedron, Point, and Sphere. The default value of Point is the fastest and forces the Scatter plot to draw all of its points as tiny points. When the Scatter plot uses the Sphere point type, it draws points but applies textures to the points so it is nearly as fast as the Point point type. Any of the other point styles place a glyph at each point in the Scatter plot's created point mesh, taking longer to render. To change the point type used to draw the Scatter plot's points, click on the <b>Appearance</b> tab in the <b>Scatter plot attributes window</b> and choose a new option from the <b>Point Type</b> combo box shown in Figure3-26. If you choose any of the glyphed point types (all except Point and Sphere) then you can also specify a point size by typing a new value into the <b>Point size</b> text field. The point size is used to determine the size of the glyph. For example, if you choose the Box point type and you enter a point size of: 0.1 then the length of all of the edges on the Box glyphs will be 0.1. If you use Point or Sphere point types then the <b>Point size</b> text field becomes the <b>Point size (pixels)</b> text field and you can set the point size in terms of pixels. </p>
