<h2><p>Drawing internal surfaces</h2></p>
<p>When you make one or more material boundaries transparent, you might want to also draw internal surfaces so you can see interior plot details that are normally removed to make the plot draw faster. To draw internal surfaces, check the <b>Draw internal surfaces</b> check box near the bottom of the <b>Boundary plot attributes window</b> or <b>FilledBoundary plot attributes window</b>.</p>
