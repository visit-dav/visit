<center><b><font size="6">VisIt 1.8.0 Release Notes</font></b></center>

<p>Welcome to VisIt's release notes page. This page describes the important
enhancements and bug-fixes that were added to this release.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Features added in version 1.8.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt now displays console output from components that it launches on remote computers. For example, this makes it possible to see the launch string used for a parallel batch system on a remote computer.</li>
<li><p>VisIt now supports setting the background for a visualization to a user-specified image. VisIt can display the background image under all of its plots and can optionally tile the image. You can choose to set an image background by opening the <b>Colors</b> tab of the <b>Annotation Window</b> and from there, you can choose the <i>Image</i> background style. Once you choose the <i>Image</i> background style, you must choose an image file by entering a filename into the <b>Background image</b> file box. Note that you currently must provide a file local to the computer on which you ran VisIt. <i>Support for image annotations in distributed mode will be added in a future version of VisIt.</i></p>
<p>In addition to support for flat background images, VisIt also now supports <i>Image sphere</i> backgrounds. This style of background image takes a flat image and warps it around a sphere that contains the whole visualization. As you move the camera in the visualization window via rotations, the visible region of the image sphere will change, simulating movement within a larger environment. Image spheres are useful for adding backgrounds such as star fields to your visualization. It is also possible to tile images by setting the number of repetitions in X and Y.</p></li>
<li>VisIt has a new 3D text annotation type that can be used to insert extruded text into a 3D visualization. The new annotation object is available on the Objects tab of the Annotation Window.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 1.8.0</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>VisIt no longer fails to save movies when the <i>Animation caching</i> setting is used in the <b>Animation Window</b>.</li>
<li>VisIt's CCM reader has been extended so it supports 2D polygonal cells in addition to previously supporting 3D polyhedral cells.</li>
<li>VisIt's Label plot now takes cell and node origins into account when labelling mesh cells and nodes.</li>
<li>VisIt's Label plot no longer uses incorrect label colors when using custom colors for node and cell labels when the <i>Restrict number of labels</i> setting is used.</li>
<li>VisIt's Revolve operator does not work with 2D Boundary plots.</li>
<li>VisIt does not show windows that have been iconified when you choose the menu option that should open the window.</li>
</ul>
