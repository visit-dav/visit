dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 26 02:45:06 PDT 2001

dnl    commented-out code to support strangeness on shared libraries on AIX
dnl    if we decide we want to use it again.  
dnl
dnl    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jan 6 13:01:21 PST 2005

dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Aug 28 17:35:44 EDT 2006
dnl    Forced test for glTexImage3D to occur in C++ mode; the library
dnl    may have it, but without a correct prototype it will fail to
dnl    compile in the main code.  Sometimes to pick it up we need to
dnl    define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES, so I added a check for that as well.
dnl
dnl    Brad Whitlock, Fri Sep 15 10:31:23 PDT 2006

dnl    Made it handle situation where there was a libsiloh5.a but not also

dnl    set SILO_LIB variable.
dnl
dnl    Eric Brugger, Mon Oct 23 13:26:26 PDT 2006

dnl
dnl    Eric Brugger, Fri Apr  6 08:53:18 PDT 2007
dnl    Added NETCDF_CXX_LIB, which contains the netcdf c++ library, for

dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jun  5 17:32:39 EDT 2007
dnl    Added the "PARDEP" substitution that expands to $(PARDEP) when parallel
dnl    builds are enabled.  This lets us avoid building dependencies for
dnl    parallel object files if we're not building parallel objects.
dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jun 14 11:22:29 EDT 2007
dnl    Added the tools/clidriver directory.

dnl    This is currently triggered by a check for OS X.
dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Oct 18 09:50:46 EDT 2007
dnl    Removed all sleep's.  They're slowing down the build and are probably

dnl
dnl    Thomas R. Treadway, Tue Oct 30 14:14:47 PDT 2007
dnl    Replacing #if define with PANTHERHACK define.

dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jun 24 14:42:58 EDT 2008
dnl    Added runtime check for OSMesa's offscreen window size limit.
dnl    (Couple other cleanups, like duplicate messages for pthreads and

dnl
dnl    Tom Fogal, Fri Jun 27 13:21:10 EDT 2008
dnl    Removed the sinclude, as we do that in acinclude.m4 now (more
dnl    appropriately).
dnl    Added a description for the define of OSMESA_SIZE_LIMIT; autoheader
dnl    complains as is.
dnl
dnl    Tom Fogal, Mon Jun 30 16:54:33 EDT 2008
dnl    Added a call to the macro I added in ac/icet.m4.
dnl
dnl    Gunther H. Weber Thu Jul 17 14:21:40 PDT 2008
dnl    Add --rpath relative to $ORIGIN enabling visit to run on some MPI
dnl    implementations (e.g., MPICH with p4 davice) that do pass environment
dnl    variables and where the -setupenv option does not work since command
dnl    line option are not available prior to calling MPI_Init.
dnl
dnl    Tom Fogal, Sun Jul 27 11:58:16 EDT 2008
dnl    Configure cognomen if the user is doing a parallel build.
dnl    
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Tue Aug 19 23:34:41 PDT 2008

dnl
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Thu Sep 10 ??:??:?? PDT 2008
dnl    Changed how ITAPS is handled to permit multiple implementations of
dnl    the ITAPS interfaces being built from the same plugin source code.
dnl    
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Thu Sep 11 10:31:38 PDT 2008
dnl    Adjusted how ITAPS implementations are handled to deal with possible
dnl    -Wl,-rpath= or -Wl,--rpath, directive in the libs component.
dnl    
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Mon Sep 15 17:29:27 PDT 2008
dnl    Replaced all refs to $SHORT_UNAME to $UNAME. The two were being used
dnl    inter-changeably and I wanted to make it consistent.
dnl
dnl    Tom Fogal, Fri Sep 19 11:24:08 MDT 2008
dnl    Define variables of filenames for SLIVR, to decide which parts to
dnl    conditionally compile.
dnl
dnl    Cyrus Harrison, Tue Sep 30 15:39:33 PDT 2008
dnl    Removed Qt WebKit & XMLPatterns b/c they do not build on AIX.
dnl    
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Thu Oct  9 18:07:17 PDT 2008
dnl    Wrapped AC_TRY_COMPILE attempts on Silo with PUSH/POP LANG C++. This
dnl    should be harmless for installations of Silo that DO NOT include the
dnl    new C++ compression code and will enable it to work correctly for those
dnl    that do.
dnl
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct 21 09:09:10 PDT 2008
dnl    Modified to use new VAC_ARG_WITH3RD macro for HDF5. This macro is in
dnl    aclocal.m4 and is intended to replace most of the code currently here
dnl    handling third party libs. Also removed SZIP stuff because it was there
dnl    only as a possibility that HDF5 might be using szip. Simplifed Silo
dnl    logic a lot and removed need for AC_TRY_COMPILE in Silo logic. Removed
dnl    'create xxx link' logic for HDF5 and SZIP. That occurs automatically
dnl    as a consequence of using VAC_ARG_WITH3RD. Removed makefiles for old
dnl    siloobj code and prep tool. Improved PDB logic to fall back to PDB lite
dnl    in Silo only if silo is defined. Fixed typo in ZLIB_LIB symbol where
dnl    a trailing 'S' was included.
dnl
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct 21 10:35:59 PDT 2008
dnl    Fixed HDF4 to handle an SZIP created by build_visit
dnl
dnl    Brad Whitlock, Tue Oct 21 11:23:55 PDT 2008
dnl    Added a few Silo-related variables back in so they can be substituted
dnl    into lib/Makefile.in for the Mac since we want to use the create_silo_link
dnl    target there.
dnl
dnl    Eric Brugger, Wed Oct 22 16:10:34 PDT 2008
dnl    Added DATA_EXE_LDFLAGS, which is used in the data directory to set
dnl    the rpath to $ORIGIN/../src/lib on linux systems.
dnl 
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Tue Dec  2 11:47:01 PST 2008
dnl    Removed silex
dnl
dnl    Brad Whitlock, Tue Dec  2 11:32:06 PST 2008
dnl    I set VISITWRAPPER_RPATH if --prefix is specified and we're on Linux
dnl    so we can set -rpath LDFLAGS that let the visit engine wrapper libraries
dnl    know where they will be installed. This is key to getting them to work
dnl    without requiring LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be specified before running the
dnl    client simulation. It also prevents the sim writers from having to do
dnl    very bad things such as using a specific VisIt rpath when linking
dnl    their codes.
dnl
dnl    Hank Childs, Fri Dec 12 16:18:34 PST 2008
dnl    Move Ice-T to later in the script so that it can benefit from correct
dnl    definitions of X11 libs and Pthreads.
dnl
dnl    Josh Stratton, Tue Dec 16 11:03:21 MST 2008
dnl    Added Tuvok the the 3rd-party builtin libraries
dnl
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Sat Dec 20 07:38:09 PST 2008
dnl    Added logic to specify itaps impl in CPPFLAGS when building itaps
dnl    plugin.
