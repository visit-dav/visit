dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 26 02:45:06 PDT 2001

dnl
dnl    Mark C. Miller, Thu Dec  1 19:31:07 PST 2005

dnl
dnl    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Aug 28 17:35:44 EDT 2006
dnl    Forced test for glTexImage3D to occur in C++ mode; the library
dnl    may have it, but without a correct prototype it will fail to
dnl    compile in the main code.  Sometimes to pick it up we need to

dnl
dnl    Brad Whitlock, Fri Sep 15 10:31:23 PDT 2006

dnl    the mesa library or the mesa stub library.
dnl
dnl    Eric Brugger, Fri Apr  6 08:53:18 PDT 2007
dnl    Added NETCDF_CXX_LIB, which contains the netcdf c++ library, for

dnl    Adaptively find data directory.  Its location is dependent on whether
dnl    you are in ClearCase or Subversion.  And for Subversion, it might not
dnl    be available at all.
dnl
dnl    Gunther H. Weber, Thu Apr 19 18:22:49 PDT 2007
