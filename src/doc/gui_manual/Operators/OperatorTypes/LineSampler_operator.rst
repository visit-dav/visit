LineSampler operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Line Sampler operator is used for sampling a 3D/2D dataset in much
the same way as the Lineout tool except in a much more defined
manner. That is, the user can define a series of "arrays"
(e.g. planes) that consists of one or more "channels" over which the
data is sampled. For each array the orientation of the plane can be
defined. Whereas for each channel, its orientation within the plane
and the sampling type and spacing can be defined. For instance, the
sampling can be a series of lines through the data, or a series of
points integrated over time.

For more information on LineSampler, see the :ref:`LineSampler`
section in the :ref:`Quantitative` chapter.
