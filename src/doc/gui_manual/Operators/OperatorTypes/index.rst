--------------

functions. Some of the operators are not be enabled by default so they do not 
show up in the **Operator** menu. Use the :ref:`Plugin Manager Window`, which 
can be opened by clicking on the **Plugin Manager** option in the 
**Main Window's Preferences menu**, to enable additional operators or disable 
operators that you rarely use.
