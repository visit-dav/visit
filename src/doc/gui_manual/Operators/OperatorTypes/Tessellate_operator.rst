Tessellate operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Tessellate operator is an operator that tessellates high order elements
so that they appear curved.

   Tessellate operator example

The Tessellate operator supports the following high order element types.

* QUADRATIC_EDGE
* CUBIC_LINE
* LAGRANGE_TRIANGLE
* QUADRATIC_TRIANGLE
* BIQUADRATIC_TRIANGLE
* LAGRANGE_QUADRILATERAL
* BIQUADRATIC_QUAD
* QUADRATIC_QUAD
* LAGRANGE_TETRAHEDRON
* QUATRADIC_TETRA
* LAGRANGE_HEXAHEDRON
* QUADRATIC_HEXAHEDRON

If the Tessellate operator encounters an unsupported element type it will
remove the element from the mesh.

Changing the tessellation accuracy
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The tessalation accuracy is controlled by the **Chord error**. It is the
ratio of a chord to the distance from the curve and is independent of the
scale of the object. The default **Chord error** is 0.035, which will
typically do a good job. Reducing the **Chord error** will improve the
discretization. The **Chord error** should only be decreased if necessary
since reducing it will increase the number of elements a single high order
element is tessellated into. This in turn increases the memory usage and
the time to perform operations. The number of elements a single high order
element gets tessellated into may easily get into the hundreds.

Merging the points
""""""""""""""""""

The points from the cells generated by the tessellation can either be
shared or not shared by cells. The default **Merge points** setting will
merge the points. Point merging typically only affects the appearance of
the Mesh plot. When points are merged, the mesh lines of individual
cells of the tessellation will be visible. When points are not merged,
the mesh lines of the high order element will typically only be visible.
