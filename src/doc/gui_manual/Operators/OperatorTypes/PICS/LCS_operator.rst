.. _LCS operator:

Lagrangian Coherent Structure operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PICS allows for the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) using a variety techniques developed by George Haller and his group at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Haller proposed that the ridges of Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE) are indicators of hyperbolic LCS (repelling and attracting). In two dimensional flows, hyperbolic LCS's turn out to be stationary curves of the averaged material shear while elliptic LCS's are stationary curves of the averaged strain. The LCS operator coupled with the Integral Curve (Hyperbolic LCS) and Limit Cycle (Elliptical LCS) operators provide a mechanism to calculate these structures and have been developed in cooperation between the VisIt PICS team and the Haller Group.

For complete details on computing elliptical LCS (closed orbits) and hyperbolic LCS (stretch and shrink lines) see the following paper: `K. Onu, F. Huhn, & G. Haller, LCS Tool: A Computational platform for Lagrangian coherent structures, J. of Computational Science, 7 (2015) 26-36 <http://georgehaller.com/reprints/lcstool.pdf>`_

INCLUDE IMAGE of elliptical and hyperbolic LCS

The LCS operator utilizes Lyapunov Exponents based on the Cauchy-Green Tensor to highlight LCS's in vector fields. The Cauchy-Green tensor is used as an equivalent definition because it is independent of the mesh discretization. As such, when performing an FTLE calculation, the time can be specified as one would for a traditional FTLE, and the resulting value will be based on the maximal Eigen value.

However, when performing the calculate with Finite Space Lyapunov Exponents (FSLE), instead of assuming a uniform mesh discretization and specifying the dispersion distance, we specify a dispersion factor which in a traditional FTLE is the dispersion distance divided by the initial distance. In the equivalent definition the dispersion distance is the maximal Eigen value. Thus when the maximal Eigen value is greater than the specified dispersion factor, then the exponent is calculated.

For more details see the following paper: `A Comparison of Finite-Time and Finite-Size Lyapunov Exponents by Ronald Peikert, Armin Pobitzer, Filip Sadlo and Benjamin Schindler, <http://www.scivis.ethz.ch/publications/pdf/2014/peikert2014comparison.pdf>`_



Source

Source types
""""""""""""

The user can seed the integral curves using the native mesh or define their own rectilinear grid.
   
Native Mesh
    Create seeds at the nodes of the native mesh. 

Regular Grid
    Create seeds at the nodes of a user-defined rectilinear grid. Parameters are:

    * Resolution - Three cartesian values separated with a space defining the number of samples in each dimension.
    * Data extents - Specify the starting and ending extents, using either the native mesh's extents (Full) or user-defined extents (Subset).


Auxilary Grid
"""""""""""""

When calculating the Jacobian for the Cauchy-Green tensor, one can use the neighboring points from the native mesh or one can specify an auxiliary grid that allows for the detection of finer features but at greater computational expense. Using an auxiliary grid is advantageous because it is independent of the native mesh. It gives more accurate results for higher order elements. Haller et al. found that for analytic flows (double gyre flow, ABC flow), the eigenvalues can be calculated from the native mesh. For simulation flows, using the auxiliary grid for eigenvalue calculations gives better results.
