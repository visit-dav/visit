File Locations
--------------
VisIt_ manages various files associated with its operation.  In most cases where
VisIt_ saves or loads data from files, the user is presented with a file browser
dialog and can explicitly choose arbitrary locations on the file system to look
for or store files. However, this is not universally true. The locations and
names of some files are *prescribed*. In this section we provide some additional
details about various file locations and names involved with the operation of
VisIt_.

Factors Effecting Prescribed File Location and Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To complicate matters, the *prescribed* location
of these files depends on a few different factors including

   * Which platform is running VisIt_.
   * How VisIt_ was launched.
   * Whether VisIt_ is running in
     :ref:`client/server mode <Client-Server Mode>`.

The Platform and the User's *Home* Directory
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Typically, on UNIX and OSX systems, prescribed configuration files
are stored in ``~/.visit`` whereas on Windows systems, they are, by default, in
``%USERPROFILE%\Documents\VisIt``, which may be something like
``C:\Users\<user-name>\Documents\VisIt``. Furthermore, on Windows, Visit_ honors
the ``CSIDL_PERSONAL`` and ``CSIDL_MYDOCUMENTS``
`CSIDL environment variables <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/csidl>`_.
Depending on the how the system is configured, these might actually resolve to a
networked drive, but most commonly, to the values described previously. Finally,
Windows users can also set the ``VISITUSERHOME`` environment variable to point
to whatever location they desire, and VisIt_ will use that location instead.
For the rest of this section, we use the symbol ``VUSER_HOME`` as a way to refer to
whatever this location happens to be on whatever platform VisIt_ is running.

The Launch Method and the *Current Working Directory*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The launch method effects what VisIt_ uses as the
`current working directory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory>`_
or ``CWD``.
On Windows and OSX it is most common to start VisIt_ by clicking an icon. In these
cases, VisIt_ uses the user's ``$HOME`` or login directory as the current working
directory.

However, when VisIt_ is started by typing a command-line at a shell terminal
prompt, then VisIt_ uses whatever that shell's ``CWD`` is at the time of
launch.

Client/Server Operation
"""""""""""""""""""""""
When running VisIt in :ref:`client/server mode <Client-Server Mode>`,
the user will need to be aware of what VisIt_ uses as ``VUSER_HOME`` and ``CWD``
on both the client and the server. These cases are pointed out in the 
descriptions below.

Files in ``VUSER_HOME``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the files associated with VisIt_ configuration are managed in 
in ``VUSER_HOME``. When running in client/server, it is the configuration files
on the *local client* that effect behavior. This means it is always the
files on the *local* machine and not the *remote* system that effect behavior.
Any configuration files that might also be on the remote server do not play a
role in effecting behavior in client/server mode.

:ref:`Settings/Preferences <Preferences Window>` File
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name: ``VUSER_HOME/config`` 
* Purpose: Holds user settings from **Preferences Window**
  plus numerous other settings such as default attributes for operators and plots,
  default database read options, default color tables, as well as the
  enabled/disabled state of various plot, operator and database plugins.
* Written: When user :ref:`saves settings <How to Save Settings>`.
* Read: On VisIt_ startup but this can be overridden by the ``-noconfig``
  command-line :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>`.
* Format: ASCII `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_

GUI Configuration File
""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name: ``VUSER_HOME/guiconfig``
* Purpose: Holds positions and sizes of various GUI windows. Also holds the list of
  recently used paths to open databases.
* Otherwise operates identically to ``VUSER_HOME/config``.

:ref:`Host Profile <host_profiles>` Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): ``VUSER_HOME/hosts/host_<site-name>_<resource-name>.xml``
  where ``<site-name>`` is something like ``ornl``, ``llnl``, ``anl`` etc. and
  ``<resource-name>`` is a machine name such as ``summit``, ``sierra``, ``theta``.
* Purpose: Stores information on how to connect to and launch jobs on a specific
  compute resource. In many cases, there are separate sets of host profile files
  for all the compute resources at a commonly used site such as LLNL CZ or RZ,
  ANL, ORNL, etc. Often sites will *post* VisIt_ host profile files in places for
  users to easily find and *install* them. Installing them is just a matter of
  copying them to ``VUSER_HOME``. In addition, updated profiles can be downloaded
  and installed automatically by VisIt_ from the **Host Profiles**
  window.
* Written: When user :ref:`saves settings <How to Save Settings>` or when user
  hits the **Export Host** button from the **Host Profiles** window.
* Read: On VisIt_ startup. All host profiles in ``VUSER_HOME/hosts/host*.xml`` are read
  on VisIt_ startup but this can be overridden by ``-noconfig``. Users should be
  aware of this behavior. If the user passes ``-noconfig`` for the purposes of
  avoiding the loading of preferences, s/he will also be without any host profiles.
* Format: ASCII `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_

.. _file_locations_visitrc:

VisIt :ref:`Run Commands (rc) <visitrc_file>` File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name: ``VUSER_HOME/visitrc``
* Purpose: Holds Python code to be executed each time VisIt_ is launched.
* Written: Whenever user hits the **Update Macros** button in the
  :ref:`Command Window <Command_Line_Window>`.
* Read: On VisIt_ startup of the CLI.
* Format: Python source code. However, there is no ``.py`` file extension in the
  file name.

:ref:`Command Window <Command_Line_Window>` Tabs Script Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): ``VUSER_HOME/script<K>.py`` where ``K`` is an
  integer in the range [1...8].
* Purpose: Hold the python code associated with each tab in the
  **Command Window**.
* Written: When user :ref:`saves settings <How to Save Settings>`.
* Read: On VisIt_ startup but this can be overridden by ``-noconfig``.
* Format: Python source code.

.. _color_table_files:

:ref:`Color Table <Color_tables>` Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): ``VUSER_HOME/<color-table-name>.ct``
* Purpose: Store a single color table for easy sharing with other users.
* Written when the user hits the **Export** button in the
  :ref:`color table window <fig-MakingItPretty-ColorTables>` from
  :menuselection:`Controls -> Color table...`.
* Read: On VisIt_ startup. All color table files in ``VUSER_HOME/*.ct``
  are read and loaded into VisIt_. However, this behavior is overridden
  by ``-noconfig``.
* Format: ASCII `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_ specifying the
  :ref:`colors and color control points <Color_tables>` for the color table.

`Custom Plugin <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Building_plugins_using_CMake>`_ Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): There are separate directories in ``VUSER_HOME``
  for *private*, user-specific operator, database and plot plugins. On UNIX/OSX,
  these are

  * ``VUSER_HOME/<visit-version>/<visit-arch>/plugins/operators/``
  * ``VUSER_HOME/<visit-version>/<visit-arch>/plugins/databases/``
  * ``VUSER_HOME/<visit-version>/<visit-arch>/plugins/plots/``

  where ``<visit-version>`` and  ``<visit-arch>`` are the VisIt_ version number
  and VisIt_ architecture moniker. On Windows, these diretories are

  * ``VUSER_HOME/operators/``
  * ``VUSER_HOME/databases/``
  * ``VUSER_HOME/plots/``

  If the ``-public`` command-line option to ``xml2cmake`` is used when building
  a plugin and the user performing this operation has appropriate permissions,
  the plugin will instead be installed to the VisIt_ *public* installation
  directory for *all* users of that installation. If a previous version of
  this plugin exists there, it will be overwritten by this operation.

  A single plugin involves a set of related files for the mdserver, engine and
  those common all VisIt_ components. For example, on UNIX the files for the
  Silo database plugin are ``libESiloDatabase_par.so``,
  ``libESiloDatabase_ser.so``, ``libISiloDatabase.so``, and
  ``libMSiloDatabase.so``.
* Purpose: Directories to hold custom plugin shared library files.
* Written: When the user makes and installs or copies the shared libraries for
  a custom plugin.
* Read: On VisIt_ startup, all :ref:`enabled <Preferences_Enabling_Plugins>`
  plugin *info* files are read. The remaining plugin files are read only when
  the plugin is actually used. In client/server mode, it is important to ensure
  that the same plugin files have been installed on *both* the client and the
  server.
* Format: Binary shared library files in the machine format of the host
  architecture.

Usage Tracking Files
""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): ``VUSER_HOME/stateA.B.C.txt`` where ``A``,
  ``B`` and ``C`` form a VisIt_ version number.
* Purpose: Holds a single ASCII integer indicating the number of times the
  associated VisIt_ version has been run. This is to facilitate suppression of
  the release notes and help after the *first* run of a new version of VisIt_.
* Written: Each time VisIt_ is started, the integer value in the associated
  state tracking file is updated.
* Read: Each time VisIt_ is started, the value in the associated state tracking
  file is read.
* Format: ASCII text

Crash Recovery Files
""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): ``VUSER_HOME/crash_recovery.$pid.session`` and
  ``VUSER_HOME/crash_recovery.$pid.session.gui`` where ``$pid`` is the process
  id of the VisIt_ viewer component.
* Purpose: Hold the most recently saved last good state of VisIt_ and VisIt_'s
  GUI windows prior to a crash.
* Written: Periodically from VisIt_ automatically. Disabled if the preference
  ``Periodically save a crash recovery file`` is unchecked in the
  **Preferences Window**. In client/server mode, crash recovery files are always
  written on the client.
* Read: When user starts VisIt_ and answers ``yes`` when queried whether to
  start up from the most recent crash recovery file or when user explicitly
  specifies the crash recovery file as an argument to the ``-sessionfile``
  command-line :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>`.
* Format: ASCII `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_, same as any
  other VisIt_ :ref:`session files <Session files>`.

Files In Other Locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several other kinds of files VisIt_ reads and writes to locations
other than ``VUSER_HOME``. These are breifly described in this section.

:ref:`Database Files <Supported File Types>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): User uses
  :menuselection:`File --> Open...` to bring up a
  file browser to select the name and location of database files.
* Purpose: Database files store the data that VisIt_ is used to analyze and
  visualize for scientific insights.
* Written: By data producers, simulation codes or instruments, upstream of
  VisIt_ in the scientific analysis workflow.
* Read: On demand when user selects :menuselection:`File --> Open...`. The
  ``-o`` command-line :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>` can be used to
  select a database file to open at startup. VisIt_ uses the
  :ref:`file's extension <Supported File Types>` to decide what
  `type of database <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Detailed_list_of_file_formats_VisIt_supports>`_
  the file is and then select the appropriate plugin to read it.
* Format: Varies by 
  `database type <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Detailed_list_of_file_formats_VisIt_supports>`_.

`VisIt Debug Log <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Debug_logs>`_ (``.vlog``) Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): The location of these files depends on whether
  VisIt_ is being run in :ref:`client/server mode <Client-Server Mode>`.
  When running client/server, some logs are written on the client and some on
  the server. On Windows, the logs on the client are always located in
  ``VUSER_HOME`` but on UNIX/OSX the logs on the client are written to whatever
  the ``CWD`` was when VisIt_ was started. If started by
  clicking on an icon, this is most
  likely the the user's login directory. If started from a command-line, it is
  whatever the shell's ``CWD`` for that command-line was. On
  the server, the logs are written to the user's login (home) directory. In a
  typical client/server scenario, the user gets gui and viewer logs locally in
  the ``CWD`` and mdserver and engine logs on the remote
  system in their login (home) directory. In a purely local scenario, all logs
  are written to the ``CWD``.

  On UNIX/OSX, the names of the log files are of the form
  ``<letter>.<component-name>.<mpi-rank-or-$pid>.<debug-level>.vlog`` where
  ``<letter>`` is one of ``A`` through ``E``, ``<component-name>`` is one of
  ``gui``, ``mdserver``, ``viewer``, ``engine_ser``, ``engine_par``,
  ``<mpi-rank-or-$pid>`` is the MPI rank for a parallel engine (``engine_par``)
  or, optionally if ``-pid`` is given as a command-line
  :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>`) the component's process id,
  and ``<debug-level>`` is the integer argument for the ``-debug``
  command-line :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>`. For example the file
  names are ``A.mdserver.5.vlog`` or ``C.engine_par.123.2.vlog``.

  On Windows, the names of the log files are slightly different and are of the
  form ``<component-name>.exe.<$pid>.<debug-level>.vlog`` or
  ``<component-name>.exe.<mpi-rank>.<$pid>.<debug-level>.vlog`` for a parellel
  engine. On Windows, the ``-pid`` command-line 
  :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>`) is ignored and ``<$pid>`` is always
  included in the file names.
* Purpose: Capture streaming debugging messages from various VisIt_ components.
* Written: Continuously by VisIt if ``-debug L`` where ``L`` is the debug *level*
  and is an integer in the range ``[1...5]`` is given on the command-line that
  starts VisIt_ or buffered if a ``b`` is given immediately afte the debug level
  integer. In addition, on UNIX/OSX VisIt_ maintains the 5 most recently written
  logs from the 5 most recent component executions each beginning with the letters
  ``A`` through ``E``, ``A`` being the most recent.
* Format: Various, ad-hoc ASCII, mostly human readable.

Plot and Operator Attribute Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): User is prompted with a file browser to select
  the name and location of these files.
* Purpose: Hold the settings for a single, specific plot or operator for easy
  sharing with other users.
* Written: Whenever user hits the **Save** button in a plot or operator
  attributes window.
* Read: Whenever user hits the **Load** button in a plot or operator attributes
  window.
* Format: ASCII `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_.

:ref:`Session Files <Session files>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): User is prompted with a file browser to select
  the name and location of these files.
* Purpose: :ref:`Session files <Session files>` are used to save and restore the
  entire state of a VisIt_ session.
* Written: On demand when user selects :menuselection:`File --> Save session...`
* Read: On demand when user selects :menuselection:`File --> Restor session...`
  or when the ``-sessionfile`` 
  command-line :ref:`startup option <StartupOptions>` is used to specify
  a session file to open at startup.
* Format: ASCII `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_.

:ref:`Save Window Files <saving_viz_window>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): User uses the
  :menuselection:`File --> Set save options...` to specify the name and location
  of subsequent saved window files as well as many other properties of a saved
  window.
* Purpose: Save the *visually relevant* aspects of the data displayed in the
  currently active window usually but not always to an image file.
* Written: On demand when user selects :menuselection:`File --> Save Window` or
  hits the **Save** button in the **Set save options** window. In client/server
  mode, keep in mind that the files are written only on the *client*.
* Read: Yes, saved images can be read into VisIt_ like any other database.
  On demand when user selects :menuselection:`File --> Open...`
* Format: Various, see :ref:`Set save options <saving_viz_window>` window.

:ref:`Export Database Files <exporting_databases>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Location and file name(s): User uses
  :menuselection:`File --> Export database...` to bring up a
  file browser to select the name and location of exported database files.
* Purpose: Exported database files are often used to share computed results
  among users, to convert among database formats, or to create a new
  more convenient database to load back into VisIt_ for further analysis.
* Written: On demand when user selects
  :menuselection:`File --> Export database...`.
  While VisIt_ *reads* over 130 different
  `types of databases <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Detailed_list_of_file_formats_VisIt_supports>`_,
  only about 20 of those types does it *write*. And some of those output types
  support only limited kinds of data. In client/server mode, keep in mind that
  the files are saved only on the server.
* Read: On demand when user selects :menuselection:`File --> Open...`
* Format: Varies by
  `database type <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Detailed_list_of_file_formats_VisIt_supports>`_.

Save Window vs. Export Database Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
As far as file location are concerned, the key issue for users to keep in 
mind regarding **Save Window** and **Export Database** operations
has to do with client/server operation. In client/server mode, **Save Window**
produces files always on the client whereas **Export Database** produces files
always on the server.

Apart from file locations, another key issue is understanding when to use
**Save Window** vs. **Export Database**. In some circumstances, these
operations can be highly similar and confusing to decide which to use.

In general, the
**Save Window** operation is used to save *visually relevant* aspects of the data
most often to an *image* file whereas the **Export Database**
operation is to output a wholly new VisIt_ *database* file. The cases where
these two operations can get confused is when non-image formats are used by
**Save Window** such as `STL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>`_,
`VTK <https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf>`_,
`OBJ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file>`_,
`PLY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)>`_ (3D formats) and Curve or
Ultra (2D, xy curve formats) formats. These non-image formats support object
and visually relevant object attributes in 2 and 3 dimensions for input to other
high end graphics tools such as for 3D printing or rendering engines. In particular,
these formats typically support aspects of the *rendering* process such as object
colors, textures, lighting and view. This is the key to what makes a **Save Window**
in these formats different from **Export Database**.

Adjusting Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Probably the easiest way to change VisIt_ configuration is to start a new VisIt_
session, make the desired changes through the GUI and then
:ref:`save settings <How to Save Settings>`. Sometimes starting the GUI to just
adjust configuration is inconvenient.

Sometimes, users need to temporarily change their configuration either to work
around or diagnose an issue. Since the majority of content in these files is
ASCII, it is possible to manually edit files without having to start VisIt_.

The user can also move (or rename) files so that VisIt_ will either find or not
find them. For example, a common trick is to change the name of
``VUSER_HOME/config`` to ``VUSER_HOME/config.orig`` so that the majority of
*settings/preferences* are not seen during VisIt_ startup but other things
such as host profiles still work. The most dramatic
variation of this approach is to move the whole ``VUSER_HOME`` directory which
on UNIX platforms might be a command like ``mv ~/.visit ~/.visit.old``.
