.. danger::
   Confirm the text here adequately characterizes that an expression has
   value everywhere over the whole mesh it is defined on. Its a field.


Scientific simulations often keep track of several dozen variables as they
run. However, only a small subset of those variables are usually written
to a simulation database to save disk space. Sometimes variables can be
derived from other variables using a variable expression. VisIt_ provides
variable expressions to allow scientists to create derived variables using
variables that are stored in the database. Expressions are extremely powerful
because they allow users to analyze new data without necessarily having to
rerun a simulation. Variables created using expressions behave just like
variables stored in a database; they appear in menus where database variables
appear and can be visualized like any other database variable.

Expression Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VisIt_ provides an **Expression Window**, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <expressionwindow>`, that allows users to create new
variables that can be used in visualizations. Users can open the
**Expression Window** by clicking on the **Expressions** option in the
**Main Window's Controls** menu. The **Expression Window** is divided
vertically into two main areas with the **Expression list** on the left
and the **Definition** area on the right.
The **Expression list** contains the list of expressions. The **Definition**
area displays the definition of the expression that is highlighted in
the **Expression list** and provides controls to edit the expression
definition.

.. _expressionwindow:

.. figure:: images/expressionwindow.png

   Expression Window

Expressions in VisIt_ are created either manually by the user or automatically
by various means including...

* Preferences

  * Mesh quality expressions
  * Time derivative expressions
  * Vector magnitude expressions

* GUI wizards
* Operators
* Databases

By default, the **Expression list** will display only those expressions
created manually by the user. A check box near the bottom of the
**Expression list** controls the display of automatically created
expressions. When this box is checked, the **Expression list** will also
include expressions created automatically by **Preferences** and **Databases**
but not expressions created automatically by **GUI wizards** or **Operators**.

Creating a new expression
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Users can create a new expression by clicking on the **Expression Window's New**
button. When the user clicks on the **New** button, VisIt_ adds a new expression
and shows its new, empty definition in the **Definitions** area. The initial
name for a new expression is *"unnamed"* followed by some integer suffix.
As the user types a new name for the expression into the **Name** text field,
the expression's name in the **Expression list** will update.

Each expression also has a **Type** that specifies the type of variable
the expression produces. The available types are:

* Scalar
* Vector
* Tensor
* Symmetric Tensor
* Array
* Curve

Users must be sure to select the appropriate type for any expression they
create. The selected type determines the menu in which the variable appears
and subsequently the plots that can operate on the variable.

To edit an expression's definition, users can type a new expression
comprised of constants, variable names, and even other VisIt_ expressions into
the **Definition** text field. The expression definition can span multiple
lines as the VisIt_ expression parser ignores whitespace. For a complete
list of VisIt_'s built-in expressions, refer to the table in section
:ref:`Built-in_expressions`. Users can also use the **Insert Function...**
menu, shown in :numref:`Figure %s <expressionwindow-functionmenu>`, to
insert any of VisIt_'s built-in expressions directly into the expression
definition. The list of built-in expressions is divided into certain
categories as shown by the structure of the **Insert Function...**
menu.

.. _expressionwindow-functionmenu:

.. figure:: images/expressionwindow-functionmenu.png

   Expression Window's Insert Function... menu

In the example shown in :numref:`Figure %s <expressionwindow-functionmenu>`,
the **Insert Function...** operation inserted a sort of *template* for the
function giving some indication of the argument(s) to the function and their
meanings. Users can then simply edit those parts of the function template that
need to be specified.

In addition to the **Insert Function...** menu, which lets users insert built-in
functions into the expression definition, VisIt_'s **Expression Window**
provides an **Insert Variable...** menu that allows users to insert variables
from the active database into the expression definition. The
**Insert Variable...** menu, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <expressionwindow-varmenu>`, is broken up into Scalars,
Vectors, Meshes, etc. and has the available variables under the appropriate
heading so they are easy to find.

.. _expressionwindow-varmenu:

.. figure:: images/expressionwindow-varmenu.png

   Expression Window's Insert Variable... menu

Some variables can only be expressed as very complex expressions containing
several intermediate subexpressions that are only used to simplify the
overall expression definition. These types of subexpressions are seldom
visualized on their own. If users want to prevent them from being added to
the **Plot** menu, turn off the **Show variable in plot menus** check box.

Deleting an expression
""""""""""""""""""""""

Users can delete an expression by clicking on it in the **Expression list**
and then clicking on the **Delete** button. Deleting an expression removes
it from the list of defined expressions and will cause unresolved references
for any other expressions that use the deleted expression. If a plot uses
an expression with unresolved references, VisIt_ will not be able to generate
it until the user resolves the reference.

Expression grammar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VisIt_ allows expressions to be written using a host of unary and binary
math operators as well as built-in and user-defined functions. VisIt_'s
expressions follow C-language syntax, although there are a few differences.
The following paragraphs detail the syntax of VisIt_ expressions.

Math operators
""""""""""""""

These include use of +, -, \*, /, ^ as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and exponentiation as infix operators, as well as the unary minus,
in their normal precedence and associativity. Parentheses may be used as
well to force a desired associativity.

*Examples: a+b^-c (a+b)*c*

Constants
"""""""""

Scalar constants include floating point numbers and integers, as well as
booleans (true, false, on, off) and strings.

*Examples: 3e4 10 "mauve" true false*

Vectors
"""""""

Expressions can be grouped into two or three dimensional vector variables
using curly braces.

*Examples: {xc, yc} {0,0,1}*

Lists
"""""

Lists are used to specify multiple items or ranges, using colons to create
ranges of integers, possibly with strides, or using comma-separated lists
of integers, integer ranges, floating points numbers, or strings.

*Examples: [1,3,2] [1:2, 10:20:5, 22] [silver, gold] [1.1, 2.5, 3.9] [level1, level2]*

Identifiers
"""""""""""

Identifiers include function names, defined variable and function names,
and file variable names. They may include alphabetic characters, numeric
characters, and underscores in any order. Identifiers should have at least
one non-numeric character so that they are not confused with integers, and
they should not look identical to floating point numbers such as 1e6.

*Examples: density x y z 3d_mesh*

Functions
"""""""""

These are used for built in functions, but they may also be used for
functions/macros defined by the user. They take specific types and numbers
of arguments within the parentheses, separated by commas. Some functions
may accept named arguments in the form identifier=value.

*Examples: sin(pi / 2) cross(vec1, {0,0,1}) my_xform(mesh1) subselect(materials=[a,b])*

Database variables
""""""""""""""""""

These are like identifiers, but may also include periods, plus, and minus
characters. A normal identifier will map to a file variable when it is not
defined as another expression. To force variables that look like integers
or floating point numbers to be interpreted as variable names, or to force
variable names which are defined by another expression to map to a variable
in a file, they should be enclosed with < and >, the left and right
carats/angle brackets. Note that quotation marks will cause them to be
interpreted as string constants, not variable names. In addition, variables
in files may be in directories within a file, so they may include slashes
in a path when in angle brackets.

*Examples: density <pressure> <a.001> <a.002> <domain1/density>*

Databases
"""""""""

A database specification looks similar to a database variable contained
in angle brackets, but it is followed by a colon before the closing angle
bracket, and it may also contain extra information. A database specification
includes a file specification possibly followed a machine name, a time
specification by itself, or a file/machine specification followed by a
time specification. A file specification is just a file name with a path
if needed. A machine specification is an at-sign @ followed by a host name.
A time specification looks much like a list in that it contains integer
numbers or ranges, or floating point numbers, separated by commas and
enclosed in square brackets. However, it may also be followed by a letter
c, t, or i to specify if the time specification refers to cycles, times,
or indices, respectively. If no letter is specified, then the parser
guesses that integers refer to cycles, floating point numbers refer to
times. There is also an alternative to force indices which is the pound
sign # after the opening square bracket.

*Examples: </dir/file:> <file@host.gov:> <[# 0:10]:> <file[1.234]:> <file[000, 023, 047]:> <file[10]c:>*

Qualified file variables
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Just like variables may be in directories within a file, they may also be
in other timesteps within the same database, within other databases, and
even within databases on other machines. To specify where a variable is
located, use the angle brackets again, and prefix the variable name with
a database specification, using the colon after the database specification
as a delimiter.

*Examples: <file:var> </dir/file:/domain/var> <file@192.168.1.1:/var> <[#0]:zerocyclevar>*


.. _Built-in_expressions:

Built-in expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. danger::
   Add examples for some of the more complicated cases.

The following table lists built-in expressions that can be used to create
more advanced expressions. Unless otherwise noted in the description, each
expression takes scalar variables as its arguments.

.. _Arithmetic_Operator_Expressions:

Arithmetic Operator Expressions (Math Expressions)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In binary arithmetic operator expressions, each operand must evaluate to
the same type field. For example, both must evaluate to a 
*scalar* field or both must evaluate to a *vector* field.

In addition, if the two expressions differ in centering (e.g. one is *zone*
or *cell* centered or *piecewise-constant* over mesh cells while the other is
*node* or *point* centered or *pieceiwse-linear* over mesh cells), VisIt_ will
*recenter* any :term:`node-centered` fields to *zone* centering to compute the
expression. This may not always be desirable. When it is not, the 
:ref:`recenter() <Recenter_Expression_Function>` may be used to explicitly
control the centering of specific operands in an expression.

.. _Sum_Expression_Operator:

Sum Operator (``+``) : ``exprL + exprR``
    Creates a new expression which is the sum of the ``exprL`` and ``exprR``
    expressions.
 
.. _Difference_Expression_Operator:

Difference Operator (``-``) : ``exprL - exprR``
    Creates a new expression which is the difference of the ``exprL`` and
    ``exprR`` expressions.

.. _Product_Expression_Operator:

Product Operator (``*``) : ``exprL * exprR``
    Creates a new expression which is the product of the ``exprL`` and

.. _Division_Expression_Operator:

Division Operator (``/``) : ``exprL / exprR``
    Creates a new expression which is the quotient after dividing the ``exprL``
    expression by the ``exprR`` expression.

Division Operator : ``divide(val_numerator, val_denominator, [div_by_zero_value, tolerance])``
    Creates a new expression which is the quotient after dividing the
    ``val_numerator`` expression by the ``val_denominator`` expression. The
    ``div_by_zero_value`` is used wherever the ``val_denominator`` is within
    ``tolerance`` of zero.

.. _Exponent_Expression_Operator:

Exponent Operator (``^``) : ``exprL ^ exprR``
    Creates a new expression which is the product after multiplying the
    ``exprL`` expression by itself ``exprR`` times.

.. _Logical_AND_Expression_Operator:

Logical AND Operator (``&``) : ``exprL & exprR``
    Creates a new expression which is the logical *AND* of the ``exprL`` and 
    ``exprR`` expressions treating each value as a binary bit field. It is
    probably most useful for expressions involving integer data but can be
    applied to expressions involving any type.

.. _Associative_Expression_Operator:

Associative Operator (``()``) : ``( expr0 OP expr1 )``
    Parenthesis, *()* are used to explicitly group partial results of sub
    expressions and control evaluation order. 

    For example, the expression ``(a + b) / c`` first computes the sum, ``a+b``
    and then divides by ``c``.

.. _Absolute_Value_Expression_Function:

Absolute Value Function (``abs()``) : ``abs(expr0)``

    argument.

.. _Ceiling_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the *ceiling* (smallest integer
    greater than or equal to) of its argument. 

.. _Exponent_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere *e* (base of the natural
    logarithm) raised to the power of its argument.

.. _Floor_Expression_Function:

Floor Function (``floor()``) : ``floor(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the *floor* (greatest integer
    less than or equal to) of its argument. 

.. _Natural_Logarithm_Expression_Function:

Natural Logarithm Function (``ln()``) : ``ln(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the natural logarithm of its
    argument.

.. _Base10_Logarithm_Expression_Function:

Base 10 Logarithm Function (``log10()``) : ``log10(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the base 10 logarithm of its
    argument.

.. _Max_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the maximum among all input
    variables.

.. _Min_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the minimum among all input
    variables.

.. _Modulo_Expression_Function:

Modulo Function (``mod()``) : ``mod(expr0,exrp1)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the first argument, ``expr0``,
    modulo the second argument, ``expr1``.

.. _Random_Expression_Function:

Random Function (``random()``) : ``random(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a random floating point number
    between 0 and 1, as computed by :math:`(\text{rand()} \% 1024) \div 1024`
    where ``rand()`` is the standard C library
    `rand() <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/>`_ random
    number generator. The argument, ``expr0``, must be a mesh variable. The seed
    used on each block of the mesh is the absolute domain number.

.. _Round_Expression_Function:

Round Function (``round()``) : ``round(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the result of rounding
    its argument.

.. _Square_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the result of squaring
    its argument. 

.. _Square_Root_Expression_Function:

Square Root Function (``sqrt()``) : ``sqrt(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the square root of
    its argument. 

Relational, Conditional and Logical Expressions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``if()`` conditional expression is designed to be used in concert with
relation and logical expressions. Together, these expressions can be used to
build up more complex expressions in which very different evaluations are
performed depending on the outcome of other evaluations. For example, the
``if()`` conditional expression can be used together with one or more
relational expressions to create a new expression which evaluates to a
dot-product on part of a mesh and to the magnitude of a divergence operator
on another part of a mesh.

.. _If_Expression_Function:

If Function (``if()``) : ``if(exprCondition, exprTrue, exprFalse)``
    Creates a new expression which is equal to ``exprTrue`` wherever 
    the condition, ``exprCondition`` is non-zero and which is equal to
    ``exprFalse`` wherever ``exprCondition`` is zero.

    For example, the expression
    ``if(and(gt(pressure, 2.0), lt(pressure, 4.0)), pressure, 0.0)``
    combines the ``if`` expression with the ``gt`` and ``lt`` expressions
    to create a new expression that is equal to ``pressure`` wherever it is
    between 2.0 and 4.0 and 0 otherwise.

.. danger::
   Confirm relational and logical expressions produce new, boolean valued
   expression variables which are themselves plottable in VisIt_. Their
   original intent may have been only to be used as args in the IF expression
   and not so much be plottable outputs in their own right.

.. _Equal_Expression_Function:

Equal Function (``eq()``) : ``eq(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a boolean value (1 or 0)
    indicating whether its two arguments are equal. A value of 1 is produced
    everywhere the arguments *are* equal and 0 otherwise.

.. _Greater_Than_Expression_Function:

Greater Than Function (``gt()``) : ``gt(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a boolean value (1 or 0)
    indicating whether ``exprL`` is greater than ``exprR``. A value of 1
    is produced everywhere ``exprL`` is greater than ``exprR`` and 0
    otherwise.

.. _Greater_Than_or_Equal_Expression_Function:

Greater Than or Equal Function (``ge()``) : ``ge(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a boolean value (1 or 0)
    indicating whether ``exprL`` is greater than or equal to ``exprR``.
    A value of 1 is produced everywhere ``exprL`` is greater than or equal to
    ``exprR`` and 0 otherwise.

.. _Less_Than_Expression_Function:

Less Than Function (``lt()``) : ``lt(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a boolean value (1 or 0)
    indicating whether ``exprL`` is less than ``exprR``. A value of 1
    is produced everywhere ``exprL`` is less than ``exprR`` and 0 otherwise.

.. _Less_Than_or_Equal_Expression_Function:

Less Than or Equal Function (``le()``) : ``le(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a boolean value (1 or 0)
    indicating whether ``exprL`` is less than or equal to ``exprR``. A value
    of 1 is produced everywhere ``exprL`` is less than or equal to ``exprR``
    and 0 otherwise.

.. _Not_Equal_Expression_Function:

Equal Function (``ne()``) : ``ne(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere a boolean value (1 or 0)
    indicating whether its two arguments are *not* equal. A value of 1
    is produced everywhere the arguments are *not* equal and 0 otherwise.
    
.. _Logical_And_Expression_Function:

Logical And Function (``and()``) : ``and(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the logical *and* of its two
    arguments. Non-zero values are treated as true whereas zero values are
    treated as false.

.. _Logical_Or_Expression_Function:

Logical Or Function (``or()``) : ``or(exprL,exprR)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the logical *or* of its two
    arguments. Non-zero values are treated as true whereas zero values are
    treated as false.

.. _Logical_Not_Expression_Function:

Logical Not Function (``not()``) : ``not(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the logical *not* of its
    argument. Non-zero values are treated as true whereas zero values are
    treated as false.

Trigonometric Expressions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. _Arc_Cosine_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the arc cosine of its
    argument. The returned value is in *radians*.

.. _Arc_Sine_Expression_Function:

    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the arc tangent of its
    argument. The returned value is in *radians*.

.. _Cosine_Expression_Function:

Cosine Function (``cos()``) : ``cos(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the cosine of its

.. _Radians_To_Degrees_Expression_Function:

Radians To Degrees Conversion Function (``rad2deg()``) : ``rad2deg(expr0)``
    Creates a new expression which is everywhere the conversion from radians 
    to degrees of its argument. The argument should be a variable defined
    in units of radians.

Vector and Color Expressions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. _Vector_Compose_Expression_Operator:

Vector Compose Operator (``{}``) : ``{expr0, expr1, ... , exprN-1}``
    Curly braces, *{}* are used to create a new expression of higher tensor rank
    from 2 or more expression of lower tensor rank.  A common use is to compose 
    several tensor rank 0 expressions (e.g. scalar expressions) into a tensor
    rank 1 expression (e.g. a vector expression). The component expressions,
    ``expr0``, ``expr1``, etc.  must all be the same tensor rank and expression
    type. For example, they must all be rank 0 (e.g. *scalar* expressions) or
    they must all be rank 1 (e.g. *vector*) expressions of the same number of
    components. If they are all scalars, the result is a tensor of rank 1 (e.g.
    a vector). If they are all vectors, the result is a tensor of rank 2 (e.g.
    a tensor). The vector compose operator is also used to compose array
    expressions.

    For example, the expression ``{u, v, w}`` takes three scalar mesh variables
    named ``u``, ``v`` and ``w`` and creates a vector mesh variable.
    
.. _Vector_Component_Expression_Operator:

Vector Component Operator (``[]``) : ``expr[I]``
    Square brackets, *[]*, are used to create a new expression of lower tensor
    rank by extracting a component from an expression of higher tensor rank. 
    Components are indexed starting from 0. If ``expr``
    is a tensor of rank 2, the result will be a tensor of rank 1 (e.g. a
    vector). If ``expr`` is a tensor of rank 1, the result will be a tensor
    of rank 0 (e.g. a scalar). To obtain the ``J``-th component of the ``I``-th
    row of a tensor of rank 2, the expression would be ``expr[I][J]``


.. _Color_Expression_Function:

Color Function (``color()``) : ``color(exprR,exprG,exprB)``
    Creates a new, RGB *vector*, expression which defines a *color* vector where
    ``exprR`` defines the *red* component, ``exprG`` defines the *green*
    component and ``exprB`` defines the *blue* component of the color vector.
    The resulting expression is suitable for plotting with the
    :ref:`truecolor_plot`. The arguments are used to define color values in
    the range 0...255. Values outside that range are clamped. No normalization
    is performed. If the arguments have much smaller or larger range than
    [0...255], it may be appropriate to select a suitable multiplicative scale
    factor.

.. _Color4_Expression_Function:

Color4 Function (``color4()``) : ``color4(exprR,exprG,exprB,exprA)``
    See :ref:`color() <Color_Expression_Function>`. This function is similar to the
    ``color()`` function but also supports *alpha-transparency* as the
    fourth argument, again in the range 0...255.

.. _Colorlookup_Expression_Function:

Color lookup Function (``colorlookup()``) : ``colorlookup(expr0,tabname,scalmode,skewfac)``
    Creates a new *vector* expression that is the color that each value in
    ``expr0`` maps to. The ``tabname`` argument is the name of the color table.
    The ``expr0`` and ``tabname`` arguments are *required*. The ``scalmode``
    and ``skewfac`` arguments are optional. Possible values for ``scalmode`` are
    ``0`` (for *linear* scaling mode), ``1`` (for *log* scaling mode) and ``2``
    (for *skew* scaling mode). The ``skewfac`` argument is *required* only for
    a ``scalmode`` of ``2``.

.. _Cross_Product_Expression_Function:

Cross Product Function (``cross()``) : ``cross(exprV0,exprV1)``
    Creates a new *vector* expression which is the vector cross product created
    by crossing ``exprV0`` *into* ``exprv1``. Both arguments must be *vector*
    expression.

.. _Dot_Proeduct_Expression_Function:

Dot Product Function (``dot()``) : ``dot(exprV0,exprV1)``
    Creates a new *scalar* expression which is the vector dot product
    of ``exprV0`` with ``exprV1``.

.. _HSVColor_Expression_Function:

HSV Color Function (``hsvcolor()``) : ``hsvcolor(exprH,exprS,exprV)``
    See :ref:`color() <Color_Expression_Function>`. This function is similar to the
    ``color()`` function but takes *Hue*, *Saturation* and *Value* (Lightness)
    arguments as inputs and produces an RGB *vector* expression.

.. _Magnitude_Expression_Function:

Magnitude Function (``magnitude()``) : ``magnitude(exprV0)``
    Creates a new *scalar* expression which is everywhere the magnitude of the
    ``exprV0``.

.. _Normalize_Expression_Function:

Normalize Function (``normalize()``) : ``normalize(exprV0)``
    Creates a new *vector* expression which is everywhere a normalized vector
    (e.g. same direction but unit magnitude) of ``exprV0``.

.. _Curl_Expression_Function:

Curl Function: ``curl()`` : ``curl(expr0)``
     Creates a new *vector* expression which is everywhere the curl of
     its input argument, which must be vector valued. In a 3D context, the
     result is also a vector. However, in a 2D context the result *vector*
     would always be ``[0,0,V]`` so expression instead returns only the 
     *scalar* V.

.. _Divergence_Expression_Function:

Divergence Function: ``divergence()`` : ``divergence(expr0)``
    Creates a new *scalar* expression which is everywhere the divergence of
    its input argument, which must be vector valued.

.. _Gradient_Expression_Function:

.. _Eigenvector_Expression_Function:

Array Expressions
"""""""""""""""""

.. _Array_Compose_Expression_Function:

Array Compose Function: ``array_compose()`` : ``array_compose(expr0, expr1, ..., exprN-1)``
    Create a new *array* expression variable which is everywhere the array
    composition of its arguments, which all must be *scalar* type.
    An array mesh variable is useful when using the label plot or when
    doing picks and wanting pick values to always return a certain selected
    set of mesh variables. But, all an array mesh variable really is is a
    convenient container to hold a group of individual scalar mesh variables.
    Each argument to the array_compose expression must evaluate to a scalar
    expression and all of the input expressions must have the same centering.
    Array variables are collections of scalar variables that are commonly used
    with certain plots to display the contents of multiple variables
    simultaneously. For example, the Label plot can display the values in an
    array variable.

.. _Array_Compose_With_Bins_Expression_Function:

Array Compose With Bins Function: ``array_compose_with_bins()`` : ``array_compose_with_bins(expr0,...,exprN-1,b0,...bn-1 )``
    This expression combines two related concepts. One is the array concept
    where a group of individual scalar mesh variables are grouped into an array
    variable. The other is a set of coordinate values (you can kinda think of
    as bin boundaries), that should be used by VisIt_ for certain kinds of
    operations involving the array variable. If there are N variables in the
    array, ``expr0``, ``expr1``, and so on, there are N+1 coordinate values
    (or bin boundaries), ``b0``, ``b1``. When such a variable is picked using
    one of VisIt_'s pick operations, VisIt_ can display a bar-graph. Each bar in
    the bar-graph has a height determined by the associated scalar mesh variable
    (at the picked point) and a width determined by the associated
    bin-boundaries.

    For example, suppose a user had an array variable, foo, composed of 5 scalar
    mesh variables, ``a1``, ``a2``, ``a3``, ``a4``, and ``a5`` like so...

    ``array_compose_with_bins(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,0,3.5,10.1,10.7,12,22)``

    For any given point on a plot, when the user picked foo, there are 5 values
    returned, the value of each of the 5 scalar variable members of foo. If the
    user arranged for a pick to return a bar-graph of the variable using the
    bin-boundaries, the result might look like…

.. _Comparison_Expressions:

Comparison Expressions
""""""""""""""""""""""
Comparing variables defined on the *same* mesh is often as simple as taking
their difference. What about comparing variables when they are defined on
different meshes? A common example is taking the difference between results
from two runs of the same simulation application. Even if the two runs operate
on computationally *identical* meshes, the fact that each run involves its own
*instance* of that mesh means that as far as VisIt_ is concerned, they are
different meshes.

In order to compose an expression involving variables on different meshes, the
*first* step is to *map* the variables onto a *common* mesh. The position-based
CMFE function and its friend, the connectivity-based CMFE function,
:ref:`conn_cmfe() <Conn_Cmfe_Expression_Function>` are the work-horse methods
needed when working with variables from *different* meshes in the *same*
expression. *CMFE* is an abbreviation for *cross-mesh field evaluation*.

The syntax for specifying CMFE expressions can be complicated. Therefore, the
GUI supports a *wizard* to help create them. See the
:ref:`Data-Level Comparisons Wizard <DataLevelComparisonsWizard>` for more
information. Here, we describe the details of creating CMFE expressions
manually.

All of the comparison expressions involve the concepts of a *donor variable*
and a *target mesh*. The donor variable (e.g. *pressure*) is the variable to
be mapped. The target mesh is the mesh onto which the donor variable is to be
mapped. In addition, the term *donor mesh* refers to the mesh upon which the
donor variable is defined.

.. _Pos_Cmfe_Expression_Function:

Position-Based CMFE Function: ``pos_cmfe()`` : ``pos_cmfe(<Donor Variable>,<Target Mesh>,<Fill>)``
   The ``pos_cmfe()`` function performs the mapping assuming the two meshes,
   that is the ``<Target Mesh>`` and the mesh upon which the
   ``<Donor Variable>`` (e.g. the *donor mesh*) is defined, share *only* a
   common spatial (positional) extent. Its friend, the
   :ref:`conn_cmfe() <Conn_Cmfe_Expression_Function>`
   function is *optimized* to perform the mapping when the two meshes are also
   *topologically identical*. In other words, their *coordinate* **and**
   *connectivity* arrays are 1:1. In this case, the mapping can be performed
   with more efficiency and numerical accuracy. Therefore, when it is possible
   and makes sense to do so, it is always best to use ``conn_cmfe()``.

   We'll describe the arguments to ``pos_cmfe()`` working backwards from the
   last.

   The last, ``<Fill>`` argument is a numerical constant that VisIt_
   will use to determine the value of the result in places on the target
   mesh that do not spatially overlap with the mesh of the donor variable. Note
   that if a value is chosen within the range of the donor variable, it may
   by difficult to distinguish regions VisIt_ deemed were non-overlapping.
   On the other hand, if a value outside the range is chosen, it will effect
   the range of the mapped variable. A common practice is to choose a value that
   is an extremum of the donor variable's range. Another practice is to
   choose a value that is easily distinguishable and then apply a threshold
   operator to remove those portions of the result. If the ``Fill`` argument
   is not specified, zero is assumed.

   Working backwards, the next argument, is the ``<Target Mesh>``.
   The ``<Target Mesh>`` argument in ``pos_cmfe()`` is always
   interpreted as a mesh *within* the currently *active* database. The CMFE
   expressions are always mapping data from *other* meshes, possibly in *other*
   databases onto the ``<Target Mesh>`` which is understood to be in the
   currently *active* database. When mapping data between meshes
   *in different databases*, the additional information necessary to specify
   the other database is encoded with a special syntax prepending the
   ``Donor Variable`` argument.

.. _Pos_Cmfe_Donor_Variable_Synax:

   The ``Donor Variable`` argument is a string argument of the form::

    <PATH-TO-DATABASE-FROM-CWD[SSS]MM:VARNAME>

   consisting of the donor variable's name and up to three pre-pending
   sub-strings which may be optionally needed to specify...

       #. ...the *Database* (``PATH-TO-DATABASE-FROM-CWD``) in which the donor variable resides,
       #. ...the *State Id* (``[SSS]``) from which to take the donor variable,
       #. ...the *Modality* (``MM``) by which states are identified in the *State Id*
          sub-string.

   Depending on circumstances, specifying the ``Donor-Variable`` argument to
   the CMFE functions can get cumbersome. For this reason, CMFE expressions
   are typically created using the
   :ref:`Data-Level Comparisons Wizard <DataLevelComparisonsWizard>`
   under the *Controls* menu. Nonetheless, here we describe the syntax and
   provide examples for a number of cases of increasing complexity in specifying
   where the ``Donor Variable`` resides.

   When the donor variable is in the same database and state as the target mesh,
   then only the variable's name is needed. The optional substrings are not.
   See case A in the examples below.

   When the donor variable is in a different database **and** the databases
   do not have multiple time states, then only sub-string 1, above, is
   needed to specify the path to the database in the file system. The path
   to the database can be specified using either *absolute* or *relative*
   paths. *Relative* paths are interpreted relative to the current working
   directory in which the VisIt_ session was started. See cases B and C
   in the examples below.

   When the donor variable is in a different database **and** the databases
   have multiple states, then all 3 sub-strings, above, are required. The
   ``State Id`` substring is a square-bracket enclosed number used to identify
   *which state* from which to take the donor variable. The ``Modality``
   substring is a one- or two-character moniker. The first character indicates
   whether the number in the the ``State Id`` substring is a cycle (``c``),
   a time (``t``), or an index (``i``). The second character, if present, is a
   ``d`` character to indicate the cycle, time or index is *relative* (e.g. a
   *delta*) to the current state. For example, the substring ``[200]c`` means to
   treat the ``200`` as a *cycle* number in the donor database whereas the
   the substring ``[-10]id`` means to treat the ``-10`` as an (``i``) index
   (``d``) delta. So, ``[200]c`` would map the *donor* at cycle 200
   to the *current* cycle of the *target* and ``[-10]id`` would map the
   *donor* at the current *index minus 10* to the *current* index of the *target*.
   In particular, the string ``[0]id`` is needed to create a CMFE that keeps
   *donor* and *target* in lock step. Note that in cases where the donor database
   does not have an exact match for the specified cycle or time, VisIt_ will chose
   the state with the cycle or time which is closest in absolute distance. For the
   *index* modality, if there is no exact match for the specified index, an error
   results. See cases D-I in the examples below.

   Note that the *relative* form of specifying the *State Id* is needed even
   when working with different states *within the same database*. In particular,
   to create an expression representing a *time derivative* of a variable in
   a database, the key insight is to realize it involves mapping a donor
   variable from one state in the database onto a mesh at another state. In
   addition, the value in using the *relative* form of specifying the
   ``State Id`` of the donor variable is that as the current time is changed,
   the expression properly identifies the different states of the donor
   variable instead of always mapping a fixed state.

   Examples...
   
::

    # Case A: Donor variable, "pressure" in same database as mesh, "ucdmesh"
    # Note that due to a limitation in Expression parsing, the '[0]id:' is
    # currently required in the donor variable name as a substitute for 
    # specifying a file system path to a database file. The syntax '[0]id:'
    # means a state index delta of zero within the active database.
    pos_cmfe(<[0]id:pressure>,<ucdmesh>,1e+15)

    # Case B: Donor variable in a different database using absolute path
    pos_cmfe(</var/tmp/foo.silo:pressure>,<ucdmesh>,1e+15)

.. _Conn_Cmfe_Expression_Function:

Connectivity-Based CMFE Function: ``conn_cmfe()`` : ``conn_cmfe(<Donor Variable>,<Target Mesh>)``
    The connectivity-based CMFE is an *optimized* version of
    :ref:`pos_cmfe() <Pos_Cmfe_Expression_Function>` for cases where the
    ``Target Mesh`` and the mesh of the ``Donor Variable`` are
    *topologically and geometrically identical*. In such cases, there is no
    opportunity for the two meshes to fail to overlap perfectly. Thus, there
    is no need for the third, ``<Fill>`` argument. In all other respects,
    ``conn_cmfe()`` performs the same function as
    :ref:`pos_cmfe() <Pos_Cmfe_Expression_Function>` except that
    ``conn_cmfe()`` *assumes* that any differences in the coordinates of the
    two meshes are numerically insignificant to the resulting mapped variable.
    In other words, differences in the coordinate fields, if they exist, are
    not incorporated into the resulting mapping.

.. _Curve_Cmfe_Expression_Function:

Curve CMFE Function: ``curve_cmfe()`` : ``curve_cmfe(<Donor Curve>,<Target Curve>)``
    The curve-based CMFE performs the same function as
    :ref:`pos_cmfe() <Pos_Cmfe_Expression_Function>` except for curves. The
    arguments specify the ``Target Curve`` and ``Donor Curve`` and the same
    syntax rules apply for specifying the ``Donor Curve`` as for the
    ``Donor Variable`` in :ref:`pos_cmfe() <Pos_Cmfe_Expression_Function>`.
    However, if curves represent different spatial extents or different
    numbers of samples or sample spacing, no attempt is made to unify them.

    Return a new *scalar* variable which is the symmetric difference of
    ``<Scalar>`` reflected about the point ``[Px, Py, Pz]``. In 2D, ``Pz``
    is still required but ignored. The ``<Fill>`` argument is a numerical
    constant that VisIt_ will use to determine the value of the result in
    places symmetry about the point doesn't overlap with the donor mesh.
    This operation involves **both** the reflection about the point **and**
    taking the difference. If the input ``<Scalar>`` is indeed symmetric
    about the point, the result will be a constant valued variable of zero.

.. _Symm_Plane_Expression_Function:

Symmetric Difference By Plane Function: ``symm_plane()`` : ``symm_plane(<Scalar>,<Fill>,[Nx,Ny,Nz,Px,Py,Pz])``
    Return a new *scalar* variable which is the symmetric difference of
    ``<Scalar>`` reflected about the plane defined by the point ``[Px, Py, Pz]``
    and normal ``[Nx, Ny, Nz]``. In 2D, the ``Nz`` and ``Pz`` arguments are
    still required but ignored. The ``<Fill>`` argument is a numerical
    constant that VisIt_ will use to determine the value of the result in
    places symmetry about the plane doesn't overlap with the donor mesh.
    This operation involves **both** the reflection about the plane **and**
    taking the difference. If the input ``<Scalar>`` is indeed symmetric about
    the plane, the result will be a constant valued variable of zero.  

.. _Symm_Transform_Expression_Function:

Symmetric Difference By Transform Function: ``symm_transform()`` : ``symm_transform(<Scalar>,<Fill>,[T00,T01,T02,...,T22])``
    Return a new *scalar* variable which is the symmetric difference of
    ``<Scalar>`` reflected through the 3x3 transformation where each point,
    ``[Px,Py,Pz]``, in the mesh supporting ``<Scalar>`` is transformed by the
    transform coefficients, ``[T00, T01,...,T22]`` as shown below. In 2D, all
    9 transform coefficients are still required but the last row and column are
    ignored. The ``<Fill>`` argument is a numerical constant that VisIt_ will
    use to determine the value of the result in places symmetry through the
    transform doesn't overlap with the donor mesh. This operation involves
    **both** the transform **and** taking the difference. If the input
    ``<Scalar>`` is indeed symmetric through the transform, the result will
    be a constant valued variable of zero.

    If *K* is the maximum value in the ``Int-Scalar`` input argument,
    the ``[Int-List]`` argument must be a square bracketed list of *K+1*
    integer values. Value *i* in the ``Int-Scalar`` input argument is used to

    This function can be used to recenter ``expr``. The second argument is
    optional and defaults to *"toggle"* if it is not specified. A value of
    *"toggle"* for the second argument means that if ``expr`` is *node*
    centered, it is recentered to *zone* centering and if ``expr`` is

Expression Compatibility Gotchas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VisIt_ will allow you to define expressions that it winds up determining to be
invalid later when it attempts to execute those expressions. Some common
issues are the mixing of incompatible mesh variables in the same expression
*without* the necessary additional functions to make them compatible.

Tensor Rank Compatibility
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

For example, what happens if you mix scalar and vector mesh variables in the
same expression? VisIt_ will allow users to define such an expression. But, when
it is plotted, the plot will fail.

As an aside, as the user goes back and forth between the Expressions window
creating and/or adjusting expression definitions, VisIt_ makes no attempt to
keep track of all the changes made in expressions and automatically update
plots as expressions change. Users have to manually clear or delete plots to
force VisIt_ to re-draw plots in which the expressions changed.

If what is really intended was a scalar mesh variable, then users must use
one of the expression functions that converts a vector to a scalar such as
the magnitude() built-in expression or the array de-reference operator.

Centering Compatibility
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Some variables are zone centered and some are node centered. What happens if
a user combines these in an expression? VisIt_ will default to zone centering
for the result. If this is not the desired result, the
:ref:`recenter() <Recenter_Expression_Function>` expression function should be
used, where appropriate, to adjust centering of some of the
terms in the expression.  Note that ordering of operations will probably be
important. For example

::

    node_var + recenter(zone_var)
    recenter(zone_var + node_var)

both achieve a :term:`node-centered` result. But, each expression is subtly
(and numerically) different. The first recenter's `zone_var` to the
nodes and then performs the summation operator at each node. In the
second, there is an implied recentering of `node_var` to the zones first. Then,
the summation operator is applied at each zone center and finally the results
are recentered back to the nodes. In all likelihood this creates in a
numerically lower quality result. The moral is that in a complex series of
expressions be sure to take care where you want recentering to occur.

Mesh Compatibility
""""""""""""""""""

In many cases, especially in Silo databases, all the available variables in a
database are not always defined on the same mesh. This can complicate matters
involving expressions in variables from different meshes.

Just as in the previous two examples of incompatible variables where the
solution was to apply some function to make the variables compatible, we have
to do the same thing when variables from different meshes are combined in an
expression. The key expression functions which enable this are called
**Cross Mesh Field Evaluation** or **CMFE** expression functions. We will only
briefly touch on these here. **CMFEs** will be discussed in much greater detail
elsewhere.

Just as for centering, we have two options when dealing with variables from
two different meshes. Each of which involves *mapping* one of the variables
onto the other variable's mesh using one of the CMFE expression functions.
