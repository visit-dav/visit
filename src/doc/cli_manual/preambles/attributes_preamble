Attribute Reference
===================

This chapter shows all the attributes that can be set to control the
behavior of VisIt. The attributes themselves are not documented, but
their names are usually quite explanatory. When a member of an attribute
can take values from a given list of options, the default option is printed
first in italic followed by a comma separated list of the other available
options.

The listing is ordered in alphabetical ordering of the name of the
attribute set. For each set the function that will provide you with
these attributes is printed in italic.
