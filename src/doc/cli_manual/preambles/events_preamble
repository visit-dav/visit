VisIt CLI Events
================

This chapter shows a table with all events that the VisIt GUI could
potentially generate. Different plugins create different events, so the
list will depend on the user configuration. The list in this section is
generated from a call to the *GetCallbackNames()* function and will
therefore list just the events that are applicable to the user that
generates this documentation.

The list is alphabetically ordered. The left column, labeled *EventName*
displays each event or callback name. The right column, labeled
*ArgCount* displays the result of calling
*GetCallbackArgumentCount(EventName)* for the corresponding event, which
returns the number of arguments a callback function for that event
should accept.
