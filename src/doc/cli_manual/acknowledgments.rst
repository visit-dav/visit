This document is primarily based on the excellent manual put together by
Brad Whitlock of Lawrence Livermore in 2005. Several years afterwards,
the content from that manual was converted to serve as online help for
the command line interpreter itself. As new routines were added, this
online help was updated. In 2010, Jakob van Bethlehem of the University
of Groningen wrote a wonderful script to convert the online help to
manual form. In 2011, Hank Childs of Lawrence Berkeley merged the
descriptions from Brad Whitlock’s original manual with the function
definitions produced by Jakob’s conversion of the online help. In
2018, Alister Maguire of Lawrence Livermore wrote a script for converting
this manual to restructuredText format to be used with Sphinx. The 
result is this manual.
