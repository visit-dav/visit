Point Tool
----------

The point tool allows you to position a single point relative to plots that 
exist in the visualization window. The point tool provides one hot point at the 
tool's origin. Clicking on the hot point and moving the mouse moves the point 
tool's origin in a plane perpendicular to the screen. Holding down the *Shift* 
key before clicking on the hot point moves the point tool's origin along the 
plot axis that most faces the user. Holding down the *Ctrl* key moves the point 
tool along the plot axis that points up.  :numref:`Figure %s <pointtool>` shows 
the point tool being used to set the origin for the :ref:`ThreeSlice operator`.
