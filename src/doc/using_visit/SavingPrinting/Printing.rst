   Printer window 

Open the **Printer Window** by selecting **Print window** from the
**Main Window's File** menu. The **Printer Window's** appearance is influenced
by the platform on which you are running VisIt so you may find that it looks
somewhat different when you use the Windows, Unix, or MacOS X versions of
VisIt. The MacOS X  version of the **Printer Window** is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s<printer_window>` .
