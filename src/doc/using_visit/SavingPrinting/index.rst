Saving and Printing
===================

In this chapter, we discuss how to save and print files from within VisIt. The
section on saving files is further broken down into four main areas: saving session files, saving 
images, saving movies, saving Cinema databases, and exporting databases. We first 
learn about saving session files using the **Save Session** window. We then learn 
about saving images of visualizations using the **Save Window** and then we move on to 
saving movies and sets of image files using the **Save movie wizard**. In addition
to movies, VisIt provides the **Save to Cinema** wizard to create Cinema image databases,
which surpass movies and allow the user to explore data from different viewpoints.
After learning to save images, movies, and Cinema databases, this chapter concentrates 
on exporting VisIt plots as databases using the **Export Database window**. Finally, 
we learn to print images of visualizations using the **Printer Window**.
