Working with Databases
======================

In this chapter, we will discuss how to work with databases in VisIt. A
database can be either a set of files on disk or a running simulation. You can
manage both types of databases using the same VisIt windows. First we'll learn
about :ref:`Supported File Types`, then the :ref:`File Open Window` which
allows you to browse the local system or a remote host to find your files.
Next, we'll learn how to open databases for visualization using the
:ref:`Sources Pane`.  After that we'll learn how to control animation in the
:ref:`Time Pane` before learning how to examine information about a database
using the :ref:`File Information Window`.
