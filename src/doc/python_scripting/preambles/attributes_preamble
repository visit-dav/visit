Attribute Reference
===================

This chapter shows all the attributes that can be set to control the
behavior of VisIt. The attributes themselves are not documented, but
their names are usually quite explanatory. When a member of an attribute
can take values from a given list of options, the default option is printed
first in italic followed by a comma separated list of the other available
options.

The listing is ordered in alphabetical ordering of the name of the
attribute set. For each set the function that will provide you with
these attributes is printed in italic.

Many of the **Plot** and **Operator** attribute methods accept an optional
``1`` argument to indicate whether or not to return the *default* or
*current* attributes. For example, ``CurveAttributes()`` returns the default
attributes for a **Curve** plot where as ``CurveAttributes(1)`` returns the
attributes of either the currently active **Curve** plot or the *first*
**Curve** plot in the plot list regardless of whether it is selected or
hidden.

Many functions return an integer where 1 means success and 0 means failure.
This behavior is represented by the type ``CLI_return_t`` in an attempt to
distinguish it from functions that may utilize the full range of integers.
