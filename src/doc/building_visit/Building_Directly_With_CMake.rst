.. _Building Directly with CMake:

Building Directly with CMake
----------------------------
If a *config site file* is available for the platform you wish to build on, VisIt_ can often be built without the use of the ``build_visit`` script, with these steps.

.. code:: bash

  git clone --recursive git@github.com:visit-dav/visit.git
  mkdir visit/build
  cd visit/build

If ``build_visit`` was used to build VisIt_ on the platform in the past, it should have created a cmake file specific to your machine which we call a *config site* file. 
CMake simply needs to be told where to find it using the ``-DVISIT_CONFIG_SITE`` option. 
Examples of *config site* files for a variety of machines VisIt_ developers directly support can be found in the `config-site <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/tree/develop/src/config-site>`_ directory.

.. code:: bash

  /path/to/cmake ../src/ -DVISIT_CONFIG_SITE="/path/to/your_computer.cmake"
  make -j

.. _CMake Variables:

CMake Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following CMake vars can be modified to suit your build needs.

When specified via a command-line invocation of CMake, they should be specified as: VARNAME:TYPE=value, eg 'VISIT_BUILD_ALL_PLUGINS:BOOL=ON'.

The defaults listed are the settings used if the Variable has not been set in a *config-site* file.

VISIT_SELECTED_OPERATOR_PLUGINS : STRING
    ';' separated list of operator plugins to build, eg: Slice;Lineout;Transform

     If not empty, will supersede the settings of VISIT_BUILD_MINIMAL_PLUGINS and VISIT_BUILD_ALL_PLUGINS for operator plugins.

VISIT_SELECTED_PLOT_PLUGINS : STRING
    ';' separated list of plot plugins to build, eg: Mesh;Pseudocolor

     If not empty, will supersede the settings of VISIT_BUILD_MINIMAL_PLUGINS and VISIT_BUILD_ALL_PLUGINS for plot plugins.


Controlling extra tools being built
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
VISIT_ENABLE_ANNOTATION_TOOLS : BOOL : ON
    Toggles the generation of annotation tools: text2polys, time_annotation.

VISIT_ENABLE_DATAGEN : BOOL: ON

Useful for developers
"""""""""""""""""""""


VISIT_CREATE_SOCKET_RELAY_EXECUTABLE: BOOL : ON
    Toggles creation of separate executable that forwards VisIt_'s socket connection between engine and component launcher.

VISIT_CREATE_XMLTOOLS_GEN_TARGETS : BOOL : ON
    Toggles the creation of build targets to run xmltools code generation.
    More information can be found in the :ref:`XML Tools<XML Tools>` section of the *Developer Manual*

    **Be careful on Windows**, *all of the codegen targets will be built unless you tell Visual Studio to build the ALL_BUILD project (instead of the Solution). 
    This will cause a lot of source files to be regenerated and may cause problems with the build.*

    Install rpath relative to executable location using \$ORIGIN tag.

CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION : BOOL : OFF
