Building VisIt
==============

In this chapter, we will discuss how to build visit. The building of VisIt_
is automated with the ``build_visit`` script. It will build VisIt_ and all of
VisIt_'s third party libraries. It can be configured to build VisIt_ with a
minimum of third party libraries to building VisIt_ with all of it's third
party libraries. This chapter describes how to build VisIt_, starting with
the most simple case and moving then moving to more complex use cases.
