Building VisIt_ from Sources
============================

In this chapter, we will discuss how to build VisIt_ from source code.
The building of VisIt_ is automated with the ``build_visit`` script.
It will build VisIt_ and all of VisIt_'s third party libraries.
It can be configured to build VisIt_ with a minimum of third party libraries to building VisIt_ with all of it's third party libraries.
This chapter describes how to build VisIt_, starting with the most simple case and then moving to more complex use cases.
