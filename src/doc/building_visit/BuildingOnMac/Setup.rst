Masonry Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The masonry scripts are bundled with VisIt_'s source code. You will need to download 
the source code and extract masonry from ``visit/src/tools/dev``. There are a few options 
for downloading the source code. If you want a released version of VisIt_ then go to the
`source code downloads page <https://visit.llnl.gov/source>`_ and look for the *VisIt sources*
link. The other option is to download from the `git repository <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit>`_.
Once you have the source code, copy ``visit/src/tools/dev/masonry`` to a location of your choosing.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the ``opts`` directory copy one of the ``*.json`` files and rename it as desired.
   For example: ``cp mb-3.1.1-darwin-10.14-x86_64-release.json mb-3.1.2-darwin-10.14-x86_64-release.json``

2. Open the JSON configuration file (see :numref:`Figure %s<masonry_config_file>`)  created in **step 1** and modify or add the following options as needed:
   
``arch``: **required**
   The build architecture (e.g., darwin-x86_64).

``boost_dir``: **optional**
   The path to boost if installed on your system. This also triggers the setting of two CMake options (**VISIT_USE_BOOST:BOOL** and **BOOST_ROOT:PATH**).

``branch``: **required** 
   The git branch to checkout and build.
   
``build_dir``: **optional** 
   The directory to place all of the files generated from the build process. If this option isn't specified the build directory will default to ``build-<json_base>`` (e.g., build-mb-3.1.2-darwin-10.14-x86_64-release) in your current working directory. 
   
``build_types``: **required** 
   A list of builds for masonry to create.

``build_visit``: **required**

``c_compiler``: **optional**
   Specify the C compiler

``entitlements``: **required for notarization**
   Specify the location of VisIt's entitlements file. The one used for VisIt releases is located in the ``opts`` directory and is named **visit.entitlements**. See `Hardened Runtime <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime>`_ for more details on entitlements.

``force_clean``: **optional**
   Removes all files and directories from your build folder.

``git``: **required** 
   ``mode``: **required** - set this option to **ssh** or **https**
   
   ``git_uname``: **optional** - github username

   ``depth``: **optional** - specify an integer value for a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits.

``make_nthreads``: **optional** 
   The number of parallel threads to use when building the source code.

``notarize``: **required for notarization**
   Specify the options needed for notarization.

Signing macOS Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To `code sign <https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2206/_index.html>`_ your VisIt_ build, you must be enrolled in the `Apple Developer Program <https://developer.apple.com/programs/>`_ and have a valid Developer ID certificate. Below are simple steps to get started, reference the links for more detailed information.

1. Enroll in the Apple Developer Program, if needed, and create your Developer ID certificates.

2. Install Apple certificates into your keychain

   * From **Xcode** go to the account preferences (``Xcode->Preferences->Account``) and select the **Manage Certificates...** button.

   * Click the **+** to add your certificates (see :numref:`Figure %s<xcode_certs_image>`).

3. Add the Developer ID signing certificate **Common Name** to the **cert** option in the masonry JSON configuration file.

App-Specific Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create an app-specific password go to: `https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage <https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage>`_ . Generate the app-specific password by navigating to: *Security->App-Specific Password*.

To avoid having a plain-text password in your config file, you can add the app-specific password to your macOS keychain. To do this, run the following command:

``security add-generic-password -a "apple-id-email" -w "app-specific password" -s "notarizing-name"``

The ``-s`` parameter is the name that this item will have in your keychain. Apple's documentation on `Customizing the Notarization Workflow <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow>`_ provides a good overview of the notarization process and a `link <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397>`_ detailing how to generate and manage app-specific passwords.
