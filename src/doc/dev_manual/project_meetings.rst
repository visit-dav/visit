Project Meetings
================

Project meetings are held one hour per week currently on Tuesday afternoons.
A second one hour *special topics* meeting is scheduled on all contributor's calendars but is used infrequently.
Dialog at the end of the Tuesday meeting determines if the *special topics* meeting time is needed.

Round Robin Dialog
------------------
The meeting begins with round-robin remarks from contributors on key items from the preceding week's work.
The intention is to keep remarks brief and to highlights mainly to ensure everyone is aware of key and impending changes related to VisIt_.
Sometimes contributors have nothing relevant to VisIt_ to mention in which case its perfectly fine for the contributor to *pass* during this round-robin dialog.

New Issue Triage
----------------
New issues are `triaged <https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-triaging-best-practices>`_.
New issues can be found through a browser using GitHub's `issue search feature <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Areviewed>`_ and searching for issues missing the ``reviewed`` label. 
During triage, issues are discussed in some detail to help determine `impact` (low, medium or high) and `likelihood` (low, medium or high) as well as other special considerations such as whether the issue is manifesting an outright `crash`, should be given higher `priority` or may represent `low hanging fruit` for a newer contributor.
Some issue submissions require lengthy discussion and dialog to help refine into one (or more) actual bug fixes or enhancement requests.
Such issues are converted to discussions and should be gathered together to be discussed in a *special topics* meeting.
