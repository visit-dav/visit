Project Meetings
================

Project meetings are held one hour per week currently on Tuesday afternoons.
A second one hour *special topics* meeting is scheduled on all contributor's calendars but is used infrequently.
Dialog at the end of the Tuesday meeting determines if the *special topics* meeting time is needed.

Round Robin Dialog
------------------
The meeting begins with round-robin remarks from contributors on key items from the preceding week's work.
The intention is to keep remarks brief and to highlights.
Because contributors are often split between multiple projects, it can be the case that a contributor has nothing to add regarding the previous week's work.

New Issue Triage
