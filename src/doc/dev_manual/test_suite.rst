Regression Testing
============================

Overview
--------
VisIt_ has a large and continually growing test suite. VisIt_'s test
suite involves a combination python scripts
in `src/test`, raw data and data generation sources in `src/testdata`
and of course the VisIt_ sources themselves. Regression tests are
run on a nightly basis. Testing exercises VisIt_'s viewer,
mdserver, engine and cli but not the GUI.


Running regression tests
--------------------------------

Where nightly regression tests are run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The regression suite is run on `LLNL's Pascal Cluster <https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/platforms/pascal>`_. Pascal runs the TOSS3 operating system, which is a flavor of Linux. If you are going to run the regression suite yourself you should run on a similar system or there will be differences due to numeric precision issues.

The regression suite is run on Pascal using a cron job that checks out VisIt_ source code, builds it, and then runs the tests.

How to run the regression tests manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The regression suite relies on having a working VisIt_ build and test data available on your local computer.
Our test data and baselines are stored using git lfs, so you need to setup git lfs and pull to have all the necessary files. 

The test suite is written in python and to source is in `src/test`. 
When you configure VisIt_, a bash script is generated in the build directory that you can use to run the test
suite out of source with all the proper data and baseline directory arguments. ::

    cd visit-build/test/
    ./run_visit_test_suite.sh


Here is an example of the contents of the generated `run_visit_test_suite.sh` script ::

    /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/build-mb-develop-darwin-10.13-x86_64/thirdparty_shared/third_party/python/2.7.14/darwin-x86_64/bin/python2.7  
    /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/src/test/visit_test_suite.py \
       -d /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/build-mb-develop-darwin-10.13-x86_64/build-debug/testdata/  \
       -b /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/src/test/../../test/baseline/   \
       -o output \
       -e /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/build-mb-develop-darwin-10.13-x86_64/build-debug/bin/visit "$@"


Once the test suite has run, the results can be found in the `output/html` directory. Open `output/html/index.html` in a web browser to view the test suite results.

Accessing regression test results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The nightly test suite results are posted to: http://portal.nersc.gov/project/visit/.

In the event of failure on the nightly run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If any tests
fail, ''all'' developers who updated the code from the last time all
tests successfully passed will receive an email indicating what failed.
In addition, failed results should be available on the web.  

If the results fail to post, the visit group on NERSC's systems may be over quota.
If you have a NERSC account you can check usage by sshing to NERSC and running the following command::

    prjquota visit

How regression testing works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workhorse script that manages the testing is `visit_test_suite.py` in 
`src/test`. Tests can be run in a variety of ways called *modes*.
For example, VisIt_'s nightly testing is run in `serial`, `parallel`
and `scalable,parallel` modes. Each of these modes represents a fundamental and
relatively global change in the way VisIt_ is doing business
under the covers during its testing. For example, the difference
between `parallel` and `scalable,parallel` modes is whether the scalable
renderer is being used to render images. In the `parallel` mode,
rendering is done in the viewer. In `scalable,parallel` mode, it
is done, in parallel, on the engine and images from each processor
are composited. Typically, the entire test suite is run in each
mode specified by the regression test policy.

There are a number
of command-line options to the test suite. `./run_visit_test_suite.sh -help`
will give you details about these options. Until we are
able to get re-baselined on the systems available outside of LLNL firewalls,
options enabling some filtering of image differences will be very useful.
Use of these options on platforms other than the currently adopted testing
platform (pascal.llnl.gov) will facilitate filtering big
differences (and probably real bugs that have been introduced)
from differences due to platform where tests are run. See the section on
filtering image differences.

There are a number of different categories of tests. The test
categories are the names of all the directories under
`src/test/tests`. The .py files in this directory tree are all
the actual test driver files that drive VisIt_'s CLI and
generate images and text to compare with baselines. In addition,
the `src/test/visit_test_main.py` file defines a number of helper Python
functions that facilitate testing including two key functions;
`Test()` for testing image outputs and `TestText()` for testing text
outputs. Of course, all the .py files in `src/test/tests` subtree
are excellent examples of test scripts.

When the test suite 
finishes, it will have created a web-browseable HTML tree in
the html directory. The actual image and text raw results
will be in the current directory and difference images will
be in the diff directory. The difference images are essentially
binary bitmaps of the pixels that are different and not the
actual pixel differences themselves. This is to facilitate
identifying the location and cause of the differences.

Adding a test involves a) adding a .py file to the appropriate
subdirectory in `src/test/tests`, b) adding the expected baselines
to `test/baselines` and, depending on the test, c) adding
any necessary input data files to `src/testdata`. 
The test suite will find your added .py files the next time it runs. 
So, you don't have to do anything special other than adding the .py file.

One subtlety about the current test modality is what we call
`mode specific baselines`. In theory, it should not matter what
mode VisIt_ is run in to produce an image. The image should be
identical across modes. In practice there is a long list of
things that can contribute to a handful of pixel differences
in the same test images run in different modes. This has lead
to mode specific baselines. In the baseline directory, there
are subdirectories with names corresponding to modes we currently
run. When it becomes necessary to add a mode specific baseline,
the baseline file should be added to the appropriate baseline
subdirectory.

In some cases, we skip a test in one mode but
not in others. Or, we temporarily disable a test by skipping it
until a given problem in the code is resolved. This is handled
by the ``--skiplist`` argument to the test suite. We maintained list of the
tests we currently skip and update it as necessary.
The default skip list file is `src/test/skip.json`.

Filtering Image Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways of both compiling and running VisIt_ to produce image and textual outputs. In many cases, we expect the image or textual outputs to be about the same (though not always bit-wise exact matches) even if the manner in which they are generated varies dramatically. For example, we expect VisIt_ running on two different implementations of the GL library to produce by and large the same images. Or, we expect VisIt_ running in serial or parallel to produce the same images. Or we expect VisIt_ running on Ubuntu Linux to produce the same images as it would running on Mac OSX. We expect and therefore wish to ignore ''minor variations''. But, we want to be alerted to ''major variations''. So when any developer runs a test, we require some means of filtering out image differences we expect from those we are not expecting.

On the other hand, as we make changes to VisIt_ source code, we may either expect or not expect image outputs for specific testing scenarios to change in either minor or dramatic ways. For example, if we fix a bug leading to a serious image artifact that just happened to be overlooked when the original baseline image was committed, we could improve the image dramatically implying a large image difference and still expect such a difference. For example, maybe the Mesh plot had a bug where it doesn't obey the Mesh line color setting. If we fix that bug, the mesh line color will likely change dramatically. But, the resultant image is expected to change too. Therefore, have a set of baselines from which we compute exact differences is also important in tracking impact of code changes on VisIt_ behavior.

These two goals, running VisIt_ tests to confirm correct behavior in a wide variety of conditions where we expect minor but not major variations in outputs and running VisIt_ tests to confirm behavior as code is changed where we may or may not expect minor or major variations are somewhat complimentary.

It may make sense for developers to generate (though not ever commit) a complete and valid set of baselines on their target development platform and then use those (uncommitted) baselines to enable them to run tests and track code changes using an exact match methodology.

Metrics:

*  ``total pixels`` -  count of all pixels in the test image

* ``plot pixels`` - count of all pixels touched by plot(s) in the test image

* ``coverage`` -  percent of all pixels that are plot pixels (plot pixels / total pixels). Test images in which plots occupy a small portion of the total image are fraught with peril and should be avoided to begin with. Images with poor coverage are more likely to produce false positives (e.g. passes that should have failed) or to exhibit somewhat random differences as test scenario is varied.

* ``dmax / dmaxp`` - maximum raw numerical / human perceptual difference in any color (R,G or B) channel or intensity (average of R, G, B colors). A good first try in filtering image differences is a dmax setting of 1. That will admit variations of 1 in any R, G or B channel or in intensity. However, for line-based plots like the mesh plot, due to differences in the way lines of the plot get scanned into pixels, this metric can fail miserably.

* ``dmed / dmedp`` - median value of raw numerical / human perceptual differences over all color channels and intensity


When running the test suite on platforms other than the currently adopted baseline platform or
when running tests in modes other than the standard modes, a couple of options
will be very useful; `-pixdiff` and `-avgdiff`. The pixdiff
option allows one to specify a tolerance on the percentage of *non*background* pixels that are different. The avgdiff option
allows one to specify a second tolerance for the case when
the pixdiff tolerance is exceeded. The avgdiff option specifies
the maximum average (intensity) difference difference allowed
averaged over all pixels that are different.

Tips on writing regression tests 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Except in cases where annotations are being specifically tested, remember to call TurnOffAllAnnotations() as one of the first actions in your test script. Otherwise, you can wind up producing images containing machine-specific annotations which will produce differences on other platforms.

* When writing tests involving text differences and file pathnames, be sure that all pathnames in the text strings passed to `TestText()` are absolute. Internally, VisIt_ testing system will filter these out and replace the machine-specific part of the path with `VISIT_TOP_DIR` to facilitate comparison with baseline text. In fact, the .txt files that get generated in the `current` dir will have been filtered and all pathnames modified to have `VISIT_TOP_DIR` in them.

* Here is a table of python tests scripts which serve as examples of some interesting and lesser known VisIt_/Python scripting practices:

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Script                            | What it demonstrates                                               |
+===================================+====================================================================+
|tests/faulttolerant/savewindow.py  |  * uses python exceptions                                          |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| tests/databases/itaps.py          |  * uses OpenDatabase with specific plugin                          |

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+


Rebaselining Test Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A python script, `rebase.py`, at `src/tests` dir can be used to rebaseline large numbers of results. In particular, this script enables a developer to rebase test results without requiring access to the test platform where testing is performed. This is becase the PNG files uploaded (e.g. posted) to VisIt_'s test results dashboard are suitable for using as baseline results. To use this script, run `./rebase.py --help.` Once you've completed using rebase.py to update image baselines, don't forget to commit your changes back to the repository.

 
Using VisIt_ Test Suite for Sim Code Testing
----------------------------------------------
VisIt_'s testing infrastructure can also be used from a VisIt_ install by simulation codes 
how want to write their own Visit-based tests.

.. CYRUS NOTE: This info seems to old to be relevant, but keeping here commented out just in case. 
.. 
.. == Troubleshooting ==
..
.. === Mesa stub issue ===
.. IMPORTANT NOTE: After the cmake transition, there is no mesa-stub issue because the viewer does not compile in a stub for mesa since doing so was non-portable. Thus, if you are using the svn trunk version of VisIt_, you cannot run into this issue. This section is being preserved for 1.12.x versions of VisIt_.
..
.. If all of your tests fail, you have likely run into the Mesa stub issue.  The regression suite is set up to do "screen captures", but default VisIt_ cannot do screen captures in "-nowin" mode.  If you run a test with the "-verbose" command and see:
..  Rendering window 1...
..  VisIt: Message - Rendering window 1...
..  VisIt: Warning - Currently, you cannot save images when in nowin mode using screen capture
..  and Mesa has been stubbed out in the viewer.  Either disable screen capture, or rebuild
..  without the Mesa stub library.  Note that the Mesa stub library was in place to prevent
..  compatibility problems with some graphics drivers.
..  Saving window 1...
..
.. then you have gotten bit by this problem.
..
.. You can correct it by running configure with:
..  --enable-viewer-mesa-stub=no
..
.. In fact, the typical configure line on davinci is:
..  ./configure CXXFLAGS=-g MAKE=gmake --enable-parallel --enable-visitmodule --enable-viewer-mesa-stub=no --enable-buildall
..
..
.. IMPORTANT NOTE: this will not automatically touch the files that need to be recompiled.  Your best bet is to touch viewer/main/*.C and recompile that directory.
..
.. You can test the Mesa stub issue with:
..   % visit -cli -nowin
..  >>> sw = SaveWindowAttributes()
..  >>> sw.screenCapture = 1
..  >>> SetSaveWindowAttributes(sw)
..  >>> SaveWindow()
..
.. If VisIt_ complains about an empty window, you do *not* have a Mesa stub issue and you *can* run regression tests.  If it complain about Mesa stubs, then you *do* have the issue and you *can't* run regression tests.
..
.. === PIL on MacOS X ===
.. If you attempt to execute runtest and it gives errors indicating that it assumed the test crashed then you might have problems with your PIL installation. These manifest as an error with text like ''"The _imaging C module is not installed"'', which can be obtained if you add the '''-v''' argument to ''runtest''.
..
.. PIL, as installed by build_visit, can pick up an invalid jpeg library on certain systems. If you run ''python -v'' and then try to ''import _imaging'' then Python will print out the reason that the library failed to import. This can often be due to missing jpeg library symbols. It is also possible to observe this situation even when libjpeg is available in /sw/lib but is compiled for a different target architecture (e.g. not x86_64) that what build_visit is using. The effect of this is that when _imaging.so library is linked, there is an error message saying saying something like...
..
..  ld: warning: ignoring file /opt/local/lib/libz.dylib, file was built for x86_64
..     which is not the architecture being linked (i386): /opt/local/lib/libz.dylib
..  ld: warning: ignoring file /sw/lib/libjpeg.dylib, file was built for i386
..    which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64): /sw/lib/libjpeg.dylib
..
.. . Later, when Python trys to import _imaging module, the dlopen fails due to unresolved jpeg symbol. Either way, the best solution the following:
..
.. # Build your own jpeg library
.. # Edit PIL's setup.py, setting JPEG_ROOT=libinclude("/path/to/my/jpeg")
.. # python ./setup.py build
.. # Look through the console output for the command that links the ''_imaging.so'' library and paste it back into the console as a new command. Edit the command so it uses /path/to/my/jpeg/lib/libjpeg.a instead of the usual -L/path -ljpeg business so it really picks up your jpeg library.
.. # python ./setup.py install
..
.. That is a painful process to be sure but it should be enough to produce a working PIL on Mac.
..
..
.. Here is a slightly easier way that I (Cyrus) was able to get PIL working on OSX:
.. * Build your own jpeg library
.. * Edit PIL's setup.py, do not modify JPEG_ROOT, instead directly edit the darwin case:
.. <source lang="python">
..         elif sys.platform == "darwin":
..             add_directory(library_dirs, "/path/to/your/jpeg/v8/i386-apple-darwin10_gcc-4.2/lib")
..             add_directory(include_dirs, "/path/to/your/jpeg/v8/i386-apple-darwin10_gcc-4.2/include")
..             # attempt to make sure we pick freetype2 over other versions
..             add_directory(include_dirs, "/sw/include/freetype2")
.. </source>
.. * python setup.py build
.. * python setup.py install

.. == Compiler Warning Regression Testing ==
..
.. [[Category: Developer documentation]]
..
.. The ultimate aim of compiler warning testing is to improve the quality of the code by averting ''would-be'' problems. However, in the presence of an already robust, run-time test suite, compiler warnings more often than not alert us to ''potential'' problems and not necessarily any real bugs that manifest for users.
..
.. Totally eliminating compiler warnings is a good goal. But, it is important to keep in mind that that goal is really only ''indirectly'' related to improving code quality. Its also important to keep in mind that all warnings are not equal nor are all compilers equal to the task of detecting and reporting them. For example, an ''unused variable'' warning in a code block may be a potential code maintenance nuisance but will not in any way manifest as a bug for a user.
..
.. As developers, when we ''fix'' warnings we typically take action by adjusting code. But, we are doing so in response to one compiler's (often myopic) view of the code and typically not to any real bug encountered by a user. We need to take care the the adjustments we make lead to improved quality. In particular, adjusting code for no other purpose except to silence a given compiler warning seems an unproductive exercise. Besides, there are many other options for managing unhelpful compiler warnings apart from adjusting actual code.
..
.. Finally, we're introducing compiler warning checking into a code that has been developed for many years by many developers without having payed significant attention to this issue. As of this writing, the existing code generates thousands of warnings. To make matters worse, we are dialing up compiler options to report as many warnings as possible. This leads to two somewhat distinct problems. One is to resolve warning issues in the existing code. The other, and the more important long term goal, is to prevent further warning issues from being introduced into the code.
..
.. If we take the appraoch that we must achieve the first '''before''' we can start on the second, we wind up holding our long term goal hostage to the laborious and resource intensive task of addressing existing warning issues. Or, we hold a gun to everyone's head to drop whatever they are doing and spend time addressing existing warnings to eliminate ''noise'' from useful warnings.
..
.. But, we don't have to do either of these. Instead, we can add logic to our regression testing framework to detect the introduction of ''new'' warning issues apart from existing warnings and then only fail the test when ''new'' warnings are introduced.
..
.. Here's how it works. A new unit test was added, <tt>test/tests/unit/compiler_warnings.py</tt>. That test checks for the existence of a file <tt>make.err</tt> just ''above'' the <tt>src, test and data</tt> dirs (thats because thats where the <tt>regressiontest_edge</tt> shell script puts it). If <tt>../make.err</tt> is not found, the test immediately exits with the ''skip'' error code indication. It is assumed that <tt>../make.err</tt> was produced from the ''current'' source code with compiler warnings dialed up (e.g. <tt>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</tt>) and <tt>stderr</tt> output from an entire ''clean'' build of the source is captured with a version of make supporing the <tt>--output-sync=lines</tt> option (or make was not run with a -j option).
..
.. The compiler_warnings.py python script examines make.err for lines containing warning. For each source file that produces a warning, a count of all warnings produced by the file is computed. A text string result suitable for input to the TestText method of VisIt_'s regression testing framework is assembled. Source filenames are sorted and then emitted along with their warning counts. The resulting text string is also a JSON string. It is this single text result that is checked for ''changes''. Note that any changes, up or down, in compiler warning counts for any source file, as well as introduction or elimination of a source file from compiler warning list, will result in a test failure.
..
.. If enough files were changed in the previous day's work, it's conceivable changes from multiple developer's commits will result in changes (some improvements and some not) to various lines of this text output. Improvements should be re-baselined. Non-improvements should be checked and ''fixed''.
..
.. To re-basline the warning count for a given source file, simply edit the <tt>compiler_warnings_by_file.txt</tt> file as appropriate. Its structure is designed for easy editing with any text editor.
..
.. To ''fix'' a new warning, there are several options. The first is to adjust the code that generated the warning. Its probably something minor and probably should be fixed. However, if the warning is itself unhelpful and fixing it will not improve the code, you can add the warning to a skip list. There is a file, <tt>compiler_warning_skips.json</tt> which contains skips for specific source files and skips for all (e.g. global) source files. This json file is read in as a python dictionary. You can simply cut the text for the warning that gets posted in the html to this file. Finally, as a last resort, you can also elect to bump up the warning count for the given source file. But, these later actions should be taken with care and perhaps vetted with other developers first.
