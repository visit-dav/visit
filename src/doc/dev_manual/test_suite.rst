Regression Testing
==================

Overview
--------
VisIt_ has a large and growing test suite.
VisIt_'s test suite involves a combination of python scripts in ``src/test``, raw input data files in archives in the top-level ``data`` directory and data generation tools in ``src/tools/data/datagen``.
Regression tests are run nightly and results are posted to VisIt_'s `test dashboard <https://visit-dav.github.io/dashboard/>`_.
Testing exercises VisIt_'s viewer, mdserver, engine and cli.
The GUI, however, is not exercised during regression testing and is instead tested manually.

Running regression tests
------------------------

Where nightly regression tests are run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The regression suite is run on `LLNL's Pascal Cluster <https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/platforms/pascal>`_.
Pascal runs the TOSS operating system, which is a flavor of Linux.
If you are going to run the regression suite yourself you should run on a similar system or there will be differences due to numeric precision issues.
If you do have to run the test suite on a different system there are options for doing :ref:`fuzzy matching <Fuzzy Matching Thresholds>`.

The regression suite is run on Pascal using a cron job that checks out VisIt_ source code, builds it, and then runs the tests.

.. _git_lfs_note:

A note about git lfs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The regression suite relies on having a working VisIt_ build and test data available on your local computer.
Our test data and baselines are stored using `git lfs <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs>`__.
Git lfs is an extension to git to *effectively* support large, binary files.
To run VisIt_'s regression suite, git lfs needs to be installed and the command ``git lfs pull`` needs be run.
In addition, ``git lfs pull`` will likely need to be periodically rerun as various git operations update files.

Files in git lfs exist as either a *pointer/proxy* file or as the *actual/real* file.
A git lfs file's content *mutates* between these two state as various git (and git lfs) operations are performed.
Only the pointer/proxy file, which is a small (< 150 bytes) text file, is managed in git.
The actual/real file, which can be very large, is managed in git lfs.
When a file is in its *pointer/proxy* state, its contents look something like ::

    version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
    oid sha256:4d7a214614ab2935c943f9e0ff69d22eadbb8f32b1258daaa5e2ca24d17e2393
    size 12345

The command ``git lfs pull`` *dereferences* pointer/proxy files causing *all* pointer/proxy files in the currently checked out branch to be replaced with their actual/real contents.

.. warning::

   If there are many pointer/proxy files in the current branch and/or the actual/real files to which the pointer files refer are very large, a ``git lfs pull`` operation can take a long time (many minutes or more).
   The operation can be restricted to specific files using the ``--include`` and ``--exclude`` options to ``git lfs``.

Other git operations can wind up updating the contents of an actual/real lfs file in the local checkout and replacing the file with updated pointer/proxy contents.

Being aware of these two states of a git lfs file is important because when such files are in their pointer/proxy state, various other kinds of VisIt_ development activities can fail indicating a problem with the file's *format*.
For example, expanding a data archive can fail ::

    % make ANAME=zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz expand
    [100%] Generating _archive_expand
    CMake Error: Problem with archive_read_open_file(): Unrecognized archive format
    CMake Error: Problem extracting tar: /Users/miller86/visit/visit/data/zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xzor as another example using ImageMagick's ``display`` command on an lfs'd ``.png`` file still in its *pointer* state ::

Or, trying to display a baseline image can fail ::

    % display ../test/baseline//databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_6.png
    display: improper image header '../test/baseline//databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_6.png'
    
When this happens, its likely because a ``git lfs pull`` operation is again needed.

There are other tell tale signs to help recognize whether an lfs'd file is in its pointer/proxy state or actua/real state.
In the examples below, ``xolotl_test_data.tar.xz`` and ``xyz_test_data.tar.xz`` are in their actual/real state while ``zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz`` is in its pointer/proxy state.
First, in their pointer/proxy state, the files are very small text files, usually less than 150 bytes ::

     % wc -c xolotl_test_data.tar.xz xyz_test_data.tar.xz zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz
     1294672 xolotl_test_data.tar.xz
      348584 xyz_test_data.tar.xz
         132 zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz

The ``file`` command will show ``ASCII text`` ::

    % file xolotl_test_data.tar.xz xyz_test_data.tar.xz zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz          
    xolotl_test_data.tar.xz:     XZ compressed data
    xyz_test_data.tar.xz:        XZ compressed data
    zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz: ASCII text

The file's contents will show the lfs pointer/proxy data ::

    % cat zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz 
    version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
    oid sha256:0de21481f2a2e1ddd0eb8e5bcf44e12980285455ce4724557d146c1fa884eb1e
    size 6696960

A ``git lfs pull`` operation will mutate all lfs'd pointer/proxy files in the current branch to their actual/real contents.
Or, in cases where that operation might take too long, restrict it to the needed files as in ::

    git lfs pull --include zipwrapper_test_data.tar.xz
    git lfs pull --include ../test/baseline/databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_6.png
    git lfs pull --include "*.silo"

How to run the regression tests manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test suite is written in python and the source is in ``src/test``.
The main driver to run the whole test suite is ``src/test/visit_test_main.py``.
Individual test ``.py`` files are in ``src/test/tests/<category>/*.py``.
When you configure VisIt_, a bash script is generated in the build directory that you can use to run the test suite out of source with all the proper data and baseline directory arguments. ::

    cd visit-build/test/
    ./run_visit_test_suite.sh

Here is an example of the contents of the generated ``run_visit_test_suite.sh`` script ::

    /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/build-mb-develop-darwin-10.13-x86_64/thirdparty_shared/third_party/python/2.7.14/darwin-x86_64/bin/python2.7  
    /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/src/test/visit_test_suite.py \
       -d /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/build-mb-develop-darwin-10.13-x86_64/build-debug/testdata/  \
       -b /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/src/test/../../test/baseline/   \
       -o output \
       -e /Users/harrison37/Work/github/visit-dav/visit/build-mb-develop-darwin-10.13-x86_64/build-debug/bin/visit "$@"

Once the test suite has run, the results can be found in the ``output/html`` directory.
There, you will find an ``index.html`` file entry that you can use to browse all the results.

If you want to restrict the amount of parallelism used in running the test suite you can do so with the ``-n`` command line option.
By default, the test suite will be run using all the cores on your system.
We have found that on some systems, running more than one test at a time may result in failures.
To work around this issue you can run one test at a time. ::

    ./run_visit_test_suite.sh -n 1

If you want to run a single test or just a few tests from the test suite you can list them on the command line.
The list of tests must be the last entries on the command line. ::

    ./run_visit_test_suite.sh -n 1 tests/databases/silo.py tests/databases/xdmf.py

There are a number of additional command-line options to the test suite.
``./run_visit_test_suite.sh -help`` will give you details about these options.

Accessing nightly regression test results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The nightly test suite results are posted to `GitHub <https://visit-dav.github.io/dashboard/>`_.

In the event of failure on the nightly run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If any tests fail, **all** developers who updated the code from the last time all tests successfully passed will receive an email indicating *something* failed.
In addition, failed results should be available on the web.  

How regression testing works
----------------------------

The workhorse script that manages the testing is ``visit_test_suite.py`` in ``src/test``.
Tests can be run in a variety of ways called *modes*.
For example, VisIt_'s nightly testing is run in ``serial``, ``parallel`` and ``scalable,parallel,icet`` modes.
Each of these modes represents a fundamental and relatively global change in the way VisIt_ is doing business under the covers during its testing.
For example, the difference between ``parallel`` and ``scalable,parallel,icet`` modes is whether the scalable renderer is being used to render images. In the ``parallel`` mode, rendering is done in the viewer.
In ``scalable,parallel,icet`` mode, it is done, in parallel, on the engine and images from each processor are composited with `IceT <https://icet.sandia.gov>`_.
Typically, the entire test suite is run in each mode specified by the regression test policy.

The mode is specified with the ``-m`` command line option.
For example, to run in ``scalable,parallel,icet`` mode use: ::

    ./run_visit_test_suite.sh -n 1 -m "scalable,parallel,icet"

For simplicity, we maintain baselines only for one *blessed* platform which is conveniently accessible to the *core* development team. 
Running the test suite anywhere else requires the use of :ref:`fuzzy matching <Fuzzy Matching Thresholds>` to ignore minor differences.
Use of these options on platforms other than the currently adopted testing platform will facilitate filtering big differences (and probably real bugs that have been introduced) from differences due to platform or configuration.

There are a number of different categories of tests. 
The test categories are the names of all the directories under ``src/test/tests``. 
The ``.py`` files in this directory tree are all the actual test driver files that drive VisIt_'s CLI and generate images and text to compare with baselines. 
In addition, the ``src/test/visit_test_main.py`` file defines a number of helper Python functions that facilitate testing including two key functions; ``Test()`` for testing image outputs and ``TestText()`` for testing text outputs. 
Of course, all the ``.py`` files in ``src/test/tests`` subtree are excellent examples of test scripts.

When the test suite finishes, it will have created a web-browseable HTML tree in the html directory. 
The actual image and text raw results will be in the current directory and difference images will be in the diff directory. 
The difference images are essentially binary bitmaps of the pixels that are different and not the actual pixel differences themselves. 
This is to facilitate identifying the location and cause of the differences.

Adding a test often involves:

a) adding a ``.py`` file to the appropriate test *category* subdirectory in ``src/test/tests``, 
b) optionally adding the expected baseline files to ``test/baselines`` and, depending on the test, 
c) optionally adding any necessary input data files to the top-level ``data`` directory. 

.. warning::

   Steps b) and c) can almost never be avoided for tests involving new database plugins.
   However, in almost all other cases, steps b) and c) can and probably should be avoided.
   Instead, developers are encouraged to adopt new practices and use new testing features where tests *and* their expected outcomes are programmatically included in *just* the ``.py``, so there is no need for separate *baseline* files and/or new data files.

The test suite will find your added ``.py`` files the next time it runs. 
So, you don't have to do anything special other than adding the .py file.

One subtlety about the current test modality is what we call *mode specific baselines*. 
In theory, it should not matter what mode VisIt_ uses to produce an image or numerical/textual output. 
The results should be identical across modes. 
In practice there is a long list of things that can contribute to subtle pixel differences images and small numerical differences in text.
This has lead to mode specific baselines. 
In the baseline directory, there are subdirectories with names corresponding to modes we currently run. 
When it becomes necessary to add a mode specific baseline, the baseline file should be added to the appropriate baseline subdirectory.

In some cases, we skip a test in one mode but not in others. 
Or, we temporarily disable a test by skipping it until a given problem in the code is resolved. 
This is handled by the ``--skiplist`` argument to the test suite. 
We maintain a list of the tests we currently skip and update it as necessary.
The default skip list file is ``src/test/skip.json``.

.. _three_results_types:

Types of Test Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VisIt_'s testing system, ``visit_test_main.py``, uses three different methods
to process and check results.

* ``Test()`` and ``TestAutoName()`` which processes ``.png`` image files
* ``TestText()`` and ``TestTextAutoName()`` which process ``.txt`` text files.
* ``TestValueXX()`` (where ``XX``==>``EQ``, ``LT``, ``LE``, etc.) which processes no files and simply checks *actual* and *expected* values passed as arguments.
* ``TestPOA()`` and ``TestFOA()`` which integrate directly with python if-then-else and try-except logic.

The ``Test()`` and ``TestText()`` methods both take the name of a file.
To process a test result, these methods output a file produced by the *current* test run and then compare it to a blessed *baseline* file stored in
`test/baseline <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/tree/develop/test/baseline>`_.

The ``TestAutoName()`` and ``TestTextAutoName()`` methods are preferred and perform the equivalent work of ``Test()`` and ``TestText()`` but generate the names of the baseline files automatically.
The auto-naming algorithm requires that the ``.py`` file be structured such that calls to ``TestAutoName()`` and/or ``TestTextAutoName()`` are made from within only top-level functions in the ``.py`` file.
Auto naming does not work if these methods are called from either the top/main of the ``.py`` file or from functions two or more levels deep.
Auto naming catenates the ``.py`` file's name with the name of the top-level function from which the call was made and adds an index/count.

Below, we outline the preferred structure for a VisIt_ test ``.py`` file.
The file is divided into top-level functions and calls to the various ``TestXXX()`` methods are issued from within one of these top-level functions.
Each top-level function performs one or more related tests involving common or highly similar setup.
Each top-level function is then invoked from the ``.py`` file's main body.
Each top-level function should return to main leaving the VisIt_ session in largely the same state as before the top-level function was invoked.
This includes deleting all associated plots, closing all associated databases, and possibly resetting any other relevant global state such as the view, lights, color table, SIL selection, etc.

Given a python file named ``gorfo.py`` structured as below, the resulting auto generated names (and section names) are indicated in the associated comments.

.. code:: python

  def histogram():
      ...
      TestAutoName() # Uses baseline file named 'gorfo_histogram_0' and calls TestSection('histogram')
      ...
      TestAutoName() # Uses baseline file named 'gorfo_histogram_1'
      ...
      TestValueEQ(name,bval,cval) # Compares baseline value, bval, to current value, cval
  
  def curve():
      ...
      TestAutoName() # Uses baseline file named 'gorfo_curve_0' and calls TestSection('curve')
      ...
      TestAutoName() # Uses baseline file named 'gorfo_curve_1'

  #
  # Main code
  #

  # Run the Histogram tests
  histogram()

  # Run the curve tests
  curve()

The one down side to using the auto-naming methods is that later restructuring of the python code can lead to changes in names of the baseline files.
Existing, top-level functions can be moved relative to each other without issue.
New tests can be added without issue.
But, removing *earlier* tests from a function or moving tests relative to each other *within* a function leads to baseline file name changes.

When they can be used, the ``TestValueXX()`` are a little more convenient because they do not involve storing data in files and having to maintain separate baseline files. 
Instead the ``TestValueXX()`` methods take both an *actual* (current) and *expected* (baseline) result as arguments directly coded in the calling ``.py`` file.
A good example of using ``TestValueXX()`` can be found in ``src/test/tests/database/boxlib.py``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../test/tests/databases/boxlib.py
    :language: Python
    :start-after: # Test precision {
    :end-before: # Test precision }

Likewise, the ``TestPOA()`` (pass on arrival) and ``TestFOA()`` (fail on arrival) methods are convenient ways to implement a test based primarily upon python logic itself with if-then-else or try-except blocks.
These methods are useful for cases where the majority of logic for determining a passed or failed test exists primarily as the python code itself being executed.
A good example is the ``src/test/tests/quickrecipes/working_with_annotations.py`` tests

.. literalinclude:: ../../test/tests/quickrecipes/working_with_annotations.py
    :language: Python
    :start-after: def using_gradient_background_colors():
    :end-before: vqr_cleanup()

While there may be many instances of ``TestFOA()`` (many ways a given bit of logic can fail) with the same ``name`` argument in a given sequence of logic for a single test outcome, they can be differentiated by a unique *tag* (typically the ``LINE()`` method identifing the line number.
However, there should be only a single ``TestPOA()`` (the one way a given bit of logic can succeed) instance with the same name for the associated test outcome.

As VisIt_ testing has evolved, understanding and improving productivity related to test design has not been a priority. 
As a result, there are likely far more image test results than are truly needed to fully vet all of VisIt_'s plotting features. 
Or, image tests are used unecessarily to confirm non-visual behavior like that a given database reader is working. 
Some text tests are better handled as ``TestValueXX()`` tests and other text tests often contain 90% *noise* text unrelated to the functionality being tested. 
This has made maintaining and ensuring portability of the test suite more laborious.

Because image tests tend to be the most difficult to make portable, a better design would minimize image tests to only those needed to validate visual behaviors, text tests would involve only the *essenteial* text of the test and a majority of tests would involve *value* type tests.

The above explanation is offered as a rational to justify that whenever possible adding *new* tests to the test suite should use the ``TestValueXX()`` or ``TestPOA()``/``TestFOA()`` approach as much as practical.

More About TestValueXX and TestPOA/FOA Type Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``TestValueXX()`` methods are similar in spirit to ``Test()`` and ``TestText()`` except operates on Python *values* passed as args both for the *current* (actual) and the *baseline* (expected) results. 
The values can be any Python object. 
When they are floats or ints or strings of floats or ints or lists/tuples of the same, these methods will round the arguments to the desired precision and do the comparisons numerically. 
Otherwise they will compare them as strings.

``TestValueEQ(case_name, actual, expected, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if ``actual == expected`` within specific precision otherwise fails.

``TestValueNE(case_name, actual, expected, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if ``actual != expected`` within specific precision otherwise fails.

``TestValueLT(case_name, actual, expected, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if ``actual < expected`` within specific precision otherwise fails.

``TestValueLE(case_name, actual, expected, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if ``actual <= expected`` within specific precision otherwise fails.

``TestValueGT(case_name, actual, expected, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if ``actual > expected`` within specific precision otherwise fails.

``TestValueGE(case_name, actual, expected, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if ``actual >= expected`` within specific precision otherwise fails.

``TestValueIN(case_name, bucket, expected, eqoper=operator.eq, prec=5)`` :
    Passes if bucket *contains* expected according to ``eqoper`` equality operator.
    Fails otherwise.

``TestFOA(name, tag='unk')``
    Fail on arrival with test case outcome name the concatenation of ``name`` and ``tag``.
    Whenever python execution arrives at a line with ``TestFOA()``, the test is considered a failure.
    Typically, ``tag`` is ``LINE()`` to indicate the python line number where failure occured.
    A given bit of test logic (e.g. a test *case*) can have *many* ``TestFOA()`` calls of the same ``name`` but with different ``tag``.
    
``TestPOA(name)``
    Pass on arrival with test case outcome name just ``name``.
    Whenever python execution arrives at a line with ``TestPOA()``, the test is considered a pass.
    A given bit of test logic (e.g. a test *case*) should have *only one* ``TestPOA()`` call.

For some examples, see `test_values_simple.py <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/blob/develop/src/test/tests/unit/test_value_simple.py>`__ and `atts_assign.py <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/blob/develop/src/test/tests/unit/atts_assign.py>`__.

Filtering Image Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are many alternative ways for both compiling and even running VisIt_ to produce any given image or textual output. 
Nonetheless, we expect results to be nearly if not perfectly identical. 
For example, we expect VisIt_ running on two different implementations of the GL library to produce by and large the same images. 
We expect VisIt_ running in serial or parallel to produce the same images. 
We expect VisIt_ running on Ubuntu Linux to produce the same images as it would running on Mac macOS. 
We expect VisIt_ running in client-server mode to produce the same images as VisIt_ running entirely remotely.

In many cases, we expect outputs produced by these alternative approaches to be nearly the same but not always bit-for-bit identical. 
Minor variations such as single pixel shifts in position or slight variations in color are inevitable and ultimately unremarkable.

When testing, it would be nice to be able to ignore variations in results attributable to these causes. 
On the other hand, we would like to be alerted to variations in results attributable to changes made to the source code.

To satisfy both of these goals, we use bit-for-bit identical matching to track the impact of changes to source code but *fuzzy* matching for anything else. 
We maintain a set of several thousand version-controlled, baseline results computed for a specific, fixed *configuration and test mode* of VisIt_. 
Nightly testing of key branches of development reveals any results that are not bit-for-bit identical to their baseline.

These *failures* are then corrected in one of two ways. 
Either the new result is wrong and additional source code changes are required to ensure VisIt_ continues to produce the original baseline. 
Or, the original baseline is wrong and it must be updated to the new result. 
In this latter situation, it is also prudent to justify the new result with a plausible explanation as to why it is expected, better or acceptable as well as to include such explanation in the commit comments.

Mode specific baselines
"""""""""""""""""""""""
VisIt_ testing can be run in a variety of modes; serial, parallel, scalable-parallel, scalable-parallel-icet, client-server, etc. 
For a fixed configuration, in most cases baseline results computed in one mode agree bit-for-bit identically with the other modes. 
However, this is not always true. 
About 2% of results vary with the execution mode. 
To handle these cases, we also maintain *mode-specific* baseline results as the need arises.

The need for a mode-specific baseline is discovered as new tests are added.
When testing reveals that VisIt computes slightly different results in different modes, a single mode-agnostic baseline will fail to match in all test modes. 
At that time, mode-specific baselines are added.

Changing Baseline Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
One weakness with this approach to testing is revealed when it becomes necessary to change the configuration used to compute the baselines. 
For example, moving VisIt_'s testing system to a different hardware platform or updating to a newer compiler or third-party library such as VTK, may result in a slew of minor variations in the results. 
Under these circumstances, we are confronted with having to individually assess possibly thousands of *minor* image differences to rigorously determine whether the new result is in fact *good* or whether some kind of issue or bug is being revealed.

In practice, we use fuzzy matching (see below) to filter out *minor* variations from *major* ones and then focus our efforts only on fully understanding the *major* cases. 
We summarily *accept* all minor variations as the *new* baselines.

Promise of Machine Learning
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In theory, we should be able to develop a machine-learning approach to filtering VisIt_'s test results that enable us to more effectily attribute variations in results to various causes. 
A challenge here is in developing a sufficiently large and fully labeled set of example results to prime the machine learning. 
This would make for a great summer project.

Fuzzy Matching Metrics
""""""""""""""""""""""
Image difference metrics are reported on terminal output and in HTML reports.

Total Pixels (``#pix``) :
    Count of all pixels in the test image

Non-Background (``#nonbg``) :
    Count of all pixels which are not background either by comparison to constant background color or if a non-constant color background is used to same pixel in background image produced by drawing with all plots hidden. 
    Note that if a plot produces a pixel which coincidentally winds up being the same color as the background, our accounting logic would count it as *background*. 
    We think this situation is rare enough as to not cause serious issues.

Different (``#diff``) :
    Count of all pixels that are different from the current baseline image.

% Diff. Pixels (``~%diff``) :
    The *precentage* of different pixels computed as ``100.0*#diff/#nonbg``

Avg. Diff (``avgdiff``) :
    The average *luminance* (gray-scale, obtained by weighting RGB channels by 1/3rd and summing) difference. 
    This is the sum of all pixel luminance differences divided by ``#diff``.

.. _Fuzzy Matching Thresholds:

Fuzzy Matching Thresholds
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are some command-line arguments to run tests that control *fuzzy* matching.
When computed results match bit-for-bit with the baseline, a **PASS** is reported and it is colored green in the HTML reports. 
When a computed result fails the bit-for-bit match but passes the fuzzy match, a **PASS** is reported on the terminal and it is colored yellow in the HTML reports.

Pixel Difference Threshold (``--pixdiff``) :
    Specifies the acceptable threshold for the ``#diff`` metric as a *percent*. Default
    is zero which implies bit-for-bit identical results.

Average Difference Threshold (``--avgdiff``) :
    Specifies the acceptable threshold for the ``avgdiff`` metric. 
    Note that this threshold applies *only* if the ``--pixdiff`` threshold is non-zero. 
    If a test is above the ``pixdiff`` threshold but below the ``avgdiff`` threshold, it is considered a **PASS**.
    The ``avgdiff`` option allows one to specify a second tolerance for the case when the ``pixdiff`` tolerance is exceeded.

Numerical (textual) Difference Threshold (``--numdiff``) :
    Specifies the acceptable *relative* numerical difference threshold in computed, non-zero numerical results. 
    The relative difference is computed as the ratio of the magnitude of the difference between the current and baseline results and the minimum magnitude value of the two results.

The command-line with ``--pixdiff=0.5 --avgdiff=0.1`` means that any result with *fewer* than 0.5% of pixels that are different is a **PASS** and anything with more than 0.5% of pixels different but where the average pixel gray-scale difference is less than .1 is still a **PASS**.

Testing on Non-Baseline Configurations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When running the test suite on platforms other than the currently adopted baseline platform or when running tests in modes other than the standard modes, the ``--pixdiff`` and ``--avgdiff`` command-line options will be very useful.

For numerical textual results, there is also a ``--numdiff`` command-line option that specifies a *relative* numerical difference tolerance in numerical textual results. 
The command-line option ``--numdiff=0.01`` means that if a numerical result is different but the magnitude of the difference divided by the magnitude of the expected value is less than ``0.01`` it is considered a **Pass**.

When specified on the command-line to a test suite run, the above tolerances wind up being applied to *all* test results computed during a test suite run. 
It is also possible to specify these tolerances in specific tests by passing them as arguments, for example ``Test(pixdiff=4.5)`` and ``TestText(numdiff=0.01)``, in the methods used to check test outputs.

Finally, it may make sense for developers to generate (though not ever commit) a complete and validated set of baselines on their target development platform and then use those (uncommitted) baselines to enable them to run tests and track code changes using an exact match methodology.
 
Tips on writing regression tests 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Whenever possible, add only new ``TestValueXX()`` type tests.

* Test images in which plots occupy a small portion of the total image are fraught with peril and should be avoided. 
  Images with poor coverage are more likely to produce false positives (e.g. passes that should have failed) or to exhibit somewhat random differences as test scenario is varied.

* Except in cases where annotations are being specifically tested, remember to call TurnOffAllAnnotations() as one of the first actions in your test script. 
  Otherwise, you can wind up producing images containing machine-specific annotations which will produce differences on other platforms.

* When setting plot and operator options, take care to decide whether you need to work from *default* or *current* attributes.
  Methods to obtain plot and operator attributes optionally take an additional ``1`` argument to indicate that *current*, rather that *default* attributes are desired. 
  For example ``CurveAttributes()`` returns *default* **Curve** plot attributes wherease ``CurveAttributes(1)`` returns *current* **Curve** plot attributes which will be the currently active plot, if it is a **Curve** plot or the first **Curve** plot in the plot list of the currently active window whether it is active or hidden. 
  If there is no **Curve** plot available, it will return the *default* attributes.

* When writing tests involving text differences and file pathnames, be sure that all pathnames in the text strings passed to ``TestText()`` are absolute. 
  Internally, VisIt_ testing system will filter these out and replace the machine-specific part of the path with ``VISIT_TOP_DIR`` to facilitate comparison with baseline text. 
  In fact, the .txt files that get generated in the *current* dir will have been filtered and all pathnames modified to have ``VISIT_TOP_DIR`` in them.

* Here is a table of python tests scripts which serve as examples of some interesting and lesser known VisIt_/Python scripting practices:

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _rebaselining_test_results:

Rebaselining Test Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A python script, ``rebase.py``, in the ``test/baseline`` dir can be used to rebaseline large numbers of results.
In particular, this script enables a developer to rebase test results without requiring access to the test platform where testing is performed. 
This is becase the PNG files uploaded (e.g. posted) to VisIt_'s test results dashboard are suitable for using as baseline results. 
To use this script, run ``./rebase.py --help.``

Here is an example workflow to rebaseline a set of results that were originally committed from macOS and are subtley different on the tier 1 testing platform we use for nightly testing...

#. First, go to the `test dashboard <https://visit-dav.github.io/dashboard/>`__ and browse for any failed results.
   Ensure you are browsing the *current* results from the previous evening.
   Failing results will appear something like what is shown below...

   .. figure:: images/rebase_main.png

   Be sure to scroll through the *entire* table of results to find all failures.

#. To learn more about which specific tests are failing, click into them and they will appear something like what is shown below...

   .. figure:: images/rebase_cases.png

#. To learn even more `specific details <Fuzzy Matching Thresholds>`__ about each failing case, click into them to find details which will appear something like what is shown below...

   .. figure:: images/rebase_details.png

#. Take note of some of the components of the URL of these cases.
   This information is needed if the results need to be rebaselined.

   .. figure:: images/rebase_url.png

If after examining the results, the new results are deemed the *correct* ones, the baselines need to be updated.
Use ``rebase.py`` for that.
That python script is designed to be launched as a standalone application.
So, the invocation looks something like... ::

    % ./rebase.py -c databases -p silo -m serial -d '2022-06-02-22:00' "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_*"
    Copying file "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_4.png"
    Warning: dramatic change in size of file (old=129/new=5939)"databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_4.png"!
    Copying file "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_5.png"
    Warning: dramatic change in size of file (old=129/new=3988)"databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_5.png"!
    Copying file "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_1.png"
    Warning: dramatic change in size of file (old=130/new=24466)"databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_1.png"!
    Copying file "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_0.png"
    Warning: dramatic change in size of file (old=130/new=24467)"databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_0.png"!
    Copying file "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_2.png"
    Warning: dramatic change in size of file (old=130/new=11474)"databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_2.png"!
    Copying file "silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_3.png"
    Warning: dramatic change in size of file (old=129/new=2842)"databases/silo/silo_curvilinear_3d_surface_3.png"!

The reason for the warnings, above, is that the local files are the LFS *pointer* files.
If a ``git lfs pull`` had been done ahead of time (which is not necessary), then the local files would have been the actual ``.png`` image files and not the LFS'd pointer files.

Once ``rebase.py`` is used, don't forget to push the changes in a new PR back to the repository.

Test data archives
------------------
Testing VisIt_ requires input data sets.
Because of the wide variety of data formats and readers VisIt_ supports, we have a wide variety of `test data archives <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/tree/develop/data>`_.
A tar-compatible archive format using the *highest* and *commonly* available compression are the two basic requirements for data archives in our development workflow.

Our practice is to store test data archives as maximally xz compressed, `tar-compatible <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats#Archiving_and_compression>`_ archives.
We use `xz (e.g. lzma2) compression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils>`_ instead of the more familiar `gzip compression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip>`_ because ``xz`` is known to compress 2-3x smaller and because in most circumstances only VisIt_ developers (not users) are burdened with having to manage any additional tooling if needed.
Any data archives for users, we make available in a choice of compressed formats which include the more familiar gzip compression.

The ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in the top-level ``data`` directory is designed to be useable independently of the rest of the VisIt_ source code tree.
After running ``cmake`` there, the command ``make help-archive`` explains how to use some convenient ``make`` targets for managing data archives.
We define four convenient ``make`` targets for creating, expanding and listing data archives.
The ``archive`` target uses python's tarfile module to create a *maximally* xz compressed archive.
On some platforms, that operation may fail.
If it does, an error message is reported informing the user to use the ``fbarchive`` target instead.

The ``fbarchive`` target is a fall-back if the ``archive`` target fails.
It uses CMake's `run a command-line tool <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.23/manual/cmake.1.html#run-a-command-line-tool>`_ feature to run ``cmake -E tar cvfJ`` but may not compress the resultant archive as well.
Users are not *required* to use these targets but they are highly recommended to ensure optimal compression and portability of the resulting data archives.

Sometimes, bulk operations on all the test data archives may take a while and developers may desire better or faster tooling.
In this case, developers may wish to manipulate the archive and compression tooling directly.
For example, this command pipe on linux... ::

   tar cvf - my_test_data | xz -9e -T0 - > my_test_data.tar.xz 

...will create a *maximally* compressed (``-9e``) archive of ``my_test_data`` using multi-threaded xz compression where the number of threads will be chosen (``-T0``) equal to match the number of hardware cores.
For more information about advanced archive and compression operations, readers are encouraged to have a look at the `tar <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html>`_ and `xz <https://linux.die.net/man/1/xz>`_ man pages.

If users do use tar and compression tools directly to *create* data archives instead of through the convenient make targets, users are required to at least confirm that *expanding* the archives with the ``expand`` target does work.
Doing so will ensure it will work for everyone everywhere.

Adding test data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes new data files need to be added to support the new tests.
This involves adding either an entirely new data archive or adding a new file to an existing data archive.
With names like ``hdf5_test_data.tar.xz``, all the data archives are named more or less for the data format(s) in which the data files they contain are stored.

Adding new tests 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add code to an existing ``.py`` file or create a new ``.py`` file copying the basic format of an existing one including boilerplat calls to functions like ``TurnOffAllAnnotations()``, using ``data_path()`` when opening a database file and ``Exit()`` when terminating a test.
* If adding a new ``.py`` file, be careful to use the correct *category* directory.
  For example, when writing tests for a new database format, add the ``.py`` file to the *databases* directory or when adding a new ``.py`` file to test a new plot, add it to the *plots* directory.
  To see existing categories, have a look at the directory/folder names in the `tests <ihttps://github.com/visit-dav/visit/tree/develop/src/test/tests>`_ directory.
  If an entirely new kind of category needs to be introduced, be sure to discuss this with other developers first.
* From within a ``.py`` file, image results are generated with the ``Test()`` function and textual results with the ``TestText()`` function.
  But, see :ref:`above <three_results_types>` for why ``TestValueXX()`` is preferred over image or text results.
  
Once logic to produce new test results via ``Test()``, ``TestText()`` or ``TestValueXX()`` are added to a ``.py`` file, the new tests can be run for the *first* time.

``Test()`` and ``TestText()`` type tests will of course *fail* the first time because there are no associated baseline results defined for them.
However, *current* results from ``Test()`` and ``TestText()`` type tests will be written to a directory name of the form ``output/current/<category>/<.py-file-name>/``.
The new results should be inspected for correctness.
If they are as expected, to create the baseline results simply copy the new ``.png`` or ``.txt`` file(s) to their respective place(s) in the ``test/baseline`` directory tree being careful to follow the same *category* and *pyfile* name as was introduced above.
Of course, don't forget to ``git add`` them for eventual commit.

Rebaselining for different configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that if you work on a machine or software configuration different from how VisIt_'s nightly testing is run, there is a chance the baseline results you create won't match, bit-for-bit, with those same results from nightly testing.
Often there can be single-pixel shifts in position or rgb color values can be off by one or two values.
Typically the differences are imperceptible except by direct, numerical comparison.
Because only developers with access to `LLNL CZ systems <https://hpc.llnl.gov/documentation/user-guides/accessing-lc-systems#logging-in-to-LLNL-machines>`_ can *generate* baselines *guaranteed* to match nightly results there, our practice is to permit developers to commit potentially non-matching baselines and allow the nightly tests to run and maybe fail.
Then, any developer can use the ``rebase.py`` `tool <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/blob/develop/test/baseline/rebase.py>`_ in ``test/baseline`` (also see the :ref:`above paragraph about using rebase.py <rebaselining_test_results>`) to update the baselines to whatever nightly testing produced to create perfect matches.

To make debugging a new test case easier, add the ``-v`` (-verbose flag) or ``-v --vargs "-debug 5"`` to the ``run_visit_test_suite.sh`` command, above.

Finally, make sure to tag the test in a comment block with a space separated list of CLASSES and MODES the test supports.

Using VisIt_'s test routines in other applications
--------------------------------------------------
VisIt_'s testing infrastructure can also be used from any VisIt_ installation by other applications that want to write their own Visit-based tests.
For more details about this, see:  `Leveraging VisIt in Sim Code RegressionTesting <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Leveraging_VisIt_in_Sim_Code_Regression_Testing>`_.


Diagnosing pluginVsInstall failures
-----------------------------------
pluginsVsInstall test output is generated in the ``current/plugins`` subdirectory of the test results location.
There will be a further subdirectory for each type of plugin: databasesVsInstall, operatorsVsInstall and plotsVsInstall.
The output consists of text files containing the name of each plugin tested and either ``success`` or one of the following errors:

* ``No installed package.`` Indicates a failure in install of VisIt.
* ``cmake configure failed`` Failure with cmake to configure the plugin for build.
* ``make failed`` Failure with the build of the plugin.
* ``cmake executable could not be found``   (rare, just for completeness)
* ``make executable could not be found``  (rare, just for completeness)

When a failure occurs, another output file is generated in ``logs/plugins`` subdirectory in the form  ``<PluginName>_build_res.txt`` which should contain sufficient information for fixing the error.

The most likely culprit for errors is missing information in one of the following files:

* ``src/include/visit-cmake.h.in`` --  Holds all the #defines needed for a build (HAVE_LIBXXX, etc).
* ``src/CMake/PluginVsInstall.cmake.in`` -- Ensures third-party include/library locations are correct for an install.
* ``src/CMake/FilterDependnecies.cmake.in`` -- Filters library dependency paths to account for differences between locations of third-party libraries used in a build vs. where they are located within an installed version of VisIt.

Regression testing on Windows
-----------------------------
Running the regression suite manually on Windows is a good way to detect Windows-specific run-time errors that may have been inadverently introduced.

A dos-batch script (``run_visit_test_suite.bat``) is generated in the ``<build>/test`` directory, and is similar to the shell script created on Linux.
The generated script turns on ``--lessverbose`` mode so that output can be viewed while the test is running. 
Output can be redirected using this syntax: ::

     run_visit_test_suite.bat > test_results.txt and 2> test_general_output.txt

Windows-specific baselines are stored in the **testing_baselines** subdirectory in the `visit-deps repo <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit-deps>`_, and were generated from a Windows 10 system with NVIDIA Quadro P1000 graphics card.
Most likely, running from a different system will yield a large number of failures due to minor pixel diffs.
The use of :ref:`fuzzy matching <Fuzzy Matching Thresholds>` to ignore minor differences might be helpful here.

When first running the test suite after new tests have been added, it is generally best to copy the baselines from ``visit/test/baselines`` to ``visit-deps/testing_baselines`` to have a good starting point for comparison.


.. CYRUS NOTE: This info seems to old to be relevant, but keeping here commented out just in case. 
.. 
.. == Troubleshooting ==
..
.. === Mesa stub issue ===
.. IMPORTANT NOTE: After the cmake transition, there is no mesa-stub issue because the viewer does not compile in a stub for mesa since doing so was non-portable. Thus, if you are using the svn trunk version of VisIt_, you cannot run into this issue. This section is being preserved for 1.12.x versions of VisIt_.
..
.. If all of your tests fail, you have likely run into the Mesa stub issue.  The regression suite is set up to do "screen captures", but default VisIt_ cannot do screen captures in "-nowin" mode.  If you run a test with the "-verbose" command and see:
..  Rendering window 1...
..  VisIt: Message - Rendering window 1...
..  VisIt: Warning - Currently, you cannot save images when in nowin mode using screen capture
..  and Mesa has been stubbed out in the viewer.  Either disable screen capture, or rebuild
..  without the Mesa stub library.  Note that the Mesa stub library was in place to prevent
..  compatibility problems with some graphics drivers.
..  Saving window 1...
..
.. then you have gotten bit by this problem.
..
.. You can correct it by running configure with:
..  --enable-viewer-mesa-stub=no
..
.. In fact, the typical configure line on davinci is:
..  ./configure CXXFLAGS=-g MAKE=gmake --enable-parallel --enable-visitmodule --enable-viewer-mesa-stub=no --enable-buildall
..
..
.. IMPORTANT NOTE: this will not automatically touch the files that need to be recompiled.  Your best bet is to touch viewer/main/*.C and recompile that directory.
..
.. You can test the Mesa stub issue with:
..   % visit -cli -nowin
..  >>> sw = SaveWindowAttributes()
..  >>> sw.screenCapture = 1
..  >>> SetSaveWindowAttributes(sw)
..  >>> SaveWindow()
..
.. If VisIt_ complains about an empty window, you do *not* have a Mesa stub issue and you *can* run regression tests.  If it complain about Mesa stubs, then you *do* have the issue and you *can't* run regression tests.
..
.. === PIL on MacOS X ===
.. If you attempt to execute runtest and it gives errors indicating that it assumed the test crashed then you might have problems with your PIL installation. These manifest as an error with text like ''"The _imaging C module is not installed"'', which can be obtained if you add the '''-v''' argument to ''runtest''.
..
.. PIL, as installed by build_visit, can pick up an invalid jpeg library on certain systems. If you run ''python -v'' and then try to ''import _imaging'' then Python will print out the reason that the library failed to import. This can often be due to missing jpeg library symbols. It is also possible to observe this situation even when libjpeg is available in /sw/lib but is compiled for a different target architecture (e.g. not x86_64) that what build_visit is using. The effect of this is that when _imaging.so library is linked, there is an error message saying saying something like...
..
..  ld: warning: ignoring file /opt/local/lib/libz.dylib, file was built for x86_64
..     which is not the architecture being linked (i386): /opt/local/lib/libz.dylib
..  ld: warning: ignoring file /sw/lib/libjpeg.dylib, file was built for i386
..    which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64): /sw/lib/libjpeg.dylib
..
.. . Later, when Python trys to import _imaging module, the dlopen fails due to unresolved jpeg symbol. Either way, the best solution the following:
..
.. # Build your own jpeg library
.. # Edit PIL's setup.py, setting JPEG_ROOT=libinclude("/path/to/my/jpeg")
.. # python ./setup.py build
.. # Look through the console output for the command that links the ''_imaging.so'' library and paste it back into the console as a new command. Edit the command so it uses /path/to/my/jpeg/lib/libjpeg.a instead of the usual -L/path -ljpeg business so it really picks up your jpeg library.
.. # python ./setup.py install
..
.. That is a painful process to be sure but it should be enough to produce a working PIL on Mac.
..
..
.. Here is a slightly easier way that I (Cyrus) was able to get PIL working on macOS:
.. * Build your own jpeg library
.. * Edit PIL's setup.py, do not modify JPEG_ROOT, instead directly edit the darwin case:
.. <source lang="python">
..         elif sys.platform == "darwin":
..             add_directory(library_dirs, "/path/to/your/jpeg/v8/i386-apple-darwin10_gcc-4.2/lib")
..             add_directory(include_dirs, "/path/to/your/jpeg/v8/i386-apple-darwin10_gcc-4.2/include")
..             # attempt to make sure we pick freetype2 over other versions
..             add_directory(include_dirs, "/sw/include/freetype2")
.. </source>
.. * python setup.py build
.. * python setup.py install

.. [[Category: Developer documentation]]
..
.. The ultimate aim of compiler warning testing is to improve the quality of the code by averting ''would-be'' problems. However, in the presence of an already robust, run-time test suite, compiler warnings more often than not alert us to ''potential'' problems and not necessarily any real bugs that manifest for users.
..
.. Totally eliminating compiler warnings is a good goal. But, it is important to keep in mind that that goal is really only ''indirectly'' related to improving code quality. Its also important to keep in mind that all warnings are not equal nor are all compilers equal to the task of detecting and reporting them. For example, an ''unused variable'' warning in a code block may be a potential code maintenance nuisance but will not in any way manifest as a bug for a user.
..
.. As developers, when we ''fix'' warnings we typically take action by adjusting code. But, we are doing so in response to one compiler's (often myopic) view of the code and typically not to any real bug encountered by a user. We need to take care the the adjustments we make lead to improved quality. In particular, adjusting code for no other purpose except to silence a given compiler warning seems an unproductive exercise. Besides, there are many other options for managing unhelpful compiler warnings apart from adjusting actual code.
..
.. Finally, we're introducing compiler warning checking into a code that has been developed for many years by many developers without having payed significant attention to this issue. As of this writing, the existing code generates thousands of warnings. To make matters worse, we are dialing up compiler options to report as many warnings as possible. This leads to two somewhat distinct problems. One is to resolve warning issues in the existing code. The other, and the more important long term goal, is to prevent further warning issues from being introduced into the code.
..
.. If we take the appraoch that we must achieve the first '''before''' we can start on the second, we wind up holding our long term goal hostage to the laborious and resource intensive task of addressing existing warning issues. Or, we hold a gun to everyone's head to drop whatever they are doing and spend time addressing existing warnings to eliminate ''noise'' from useful warnings.
..
.. But, we don't have to do either of these. Instead, we can add logic to our regression testing framework to detect the introduction of ''new'' warning issues apart from existing warnings and then only fail the test when ''new'' warnings are introduced.
..
.. Here's how it works. A new unit test was added, <tt>test/tests/unit/compiler_warnings.py</tt>. That test checks for the existence of a file <tt>make.err</tt> just ''above'' the <tt>src, test and data</tt> dirs (thats because thats where the <tt>regressiontest_edge</tt> shell script puts it). If <tt>../make.err</tt> is not found, the test immediately exits with the ''skip'' error code indication. It is assumed that <tt>../make.err</tt> was produced from the ''current'' source code with compiler warnings dialed up (e.g. <tt>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</tt>) and <tt>stderr</tt> output from an entire ''clean'' build of the source is captured with a version of make supporing the <tt>--output-sync=lines</tt> option (or make was not run with a -j option).
..
.. The compiler_warnings.py python script examines make.err for lines containing warning. For each source file that produces a warning, a count of all warnings produced by the file is computed. A text string result suitable for input to the TestText method of VisIt_'s regression testing framework is assembled. Source filenames are sorted and then emitted along with their warning counts. The resulting text string is also a JSON string. It is this single text result that is checked for ''changes''. Note that any changes, up or down, in compiler warning counts for any source file, as well as introduction or elimination of a source file from compiler warning list, will result in a test failure.
..
.. If enough files were changed in the previous day's work, it's conceivable changes from multiple developer's commits will result in changes (some improvements and some not) to various lines of this text output. Improvements should be re-baselined. Non-improvements should be checked and ''fixed''.
..
.. To re-basline the warning count for a given source file, simply edit the <tt>compiler_warnings_by_file.txt</tt> file as appropriate. Its structure is designed for easy editing with any text editor.
..
.. To ''fix'' a new warning, there are several options. The first is to adjust the code that generated the warning. Its probably something minor and probably should be fixed. However, if the warning is itself unhelpful and fixing it will not improve the code, you can add the warning to a skip list. There is a file, <tt>compiler_warning_skips.json</tt> which contains skips for specific source files and skips for all (e.g. global) source files. This json file is read in as a python dictionary. You can simply cut the text for the warning that gets posted in the html to this file. Finally, as a last resort, you can also elect to bump up the warning count for the given source file. But, these later actions should be taken with care and perhaps vetted with other developers first.
