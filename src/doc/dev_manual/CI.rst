Docker Containers For CI Testing
=================================

We use Azure Pipelines for CI testing Visit's Pull Requests.

* `Ascent Azure DevOps Space <https://dev.azure.com/visit-dav/VisIt/>`_


To speed up our CI testing we use Docker containers with pre-built third party
libraries (TPLs). These containers leverage our ``build_visit`` third party
build process. The Docker files and build scripts used to create 
these containers are in ``scripts/ci/docker``. To update the containers
(assuming you have Docker installed):

 * Run ``python build_docker_visit_ci.py`` to build and tag a new version
   of our TPL container.

  This tag will include today's day and a short substring of the
  current git hash. 
  Example Tag: ``visitdav/visit-ci-develop:2020-08-24-shac49c21``

 * Run ``docker push <container-name>`` to push the container image
   to `VisIt's DockerHub Registry <https://hub.docker.com/orgs/visitdav>`_.

  If you do not already have a DockerHub account, go
  `here <https://hub.docker.com/signup >`_  and sign up for one. Then
  contact another member of `visitdav <https://hub.docker.com/orgs/visitdav>`_
  and ask to be added to the organization.

  You will need to be logged into DockerHub to successfully push. If you
  are not logged in the process will ask for your DockerHub username
  and password on the command line.
  Example Push Command:
   ``docker push visitdav/visit-ci-develop:2020-08-24-shac49c21``

 * To change which Docker Image is used by Azure, edit ``azure-pipelines.yml``
   and change `container_tag` variable. ::

    #####
    # TO USE A NEW CONTAINER, UPDATE TAG NAME HERE AS PART OF YOUR PR!
    #####
    variables:
      container_tag: visitdav/visit-ci-develop:2020-08-24-shac49c21

When the PR is merged, the azure changes will be merged and PRs to develop 
will now use the new container.
