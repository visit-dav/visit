VisIt_ Tutorials
================

This manual contains a series of hands on tutorials that expose the user to the features in VisIt_. The first three tutorials form a good basis for using VisIt_, including the basics of using the Graphical User Interface (GUI), performing data analysis and using Python to script and automate tasks in VisIt_. After that are a series of tutorials that cover advanced topics in detail.

Here are links to the datasets used in the VisIt Basics, Data Analysis and Scripting tutorials.
