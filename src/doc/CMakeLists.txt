#
#   Mark C. Miller, Mon Jun  8 16:45:05 PDT 2020
#   Added linkcheck builder
#
#   Kathleen Biagas, Wed Oct 21, 2020
#   Replaced old logic with python-3 creation of manuals, which was moved
#   from root CMakeLists.txt.
#
#   Kathleen Biagas, Thu Jan 7, 2021
#   Merge logic for creating the build and install commands, they are the
#   same for all platforms, except the sphinx build command which is
#   different on Windows.  Added logic to ensure sphinx build command exists.
#
#   Eric Brugger, Wed Feb 10 15:07:41 PST 2021
#   Update for switch to Python 3.
#
#   Kathleen Biagas, Thu Apr 22, 2021
#   Don't build manuals for VISIT_STATIC, as sphinx won't be built.
#
#   Kathleen Biagas, Thu July 1, 2021
#   Change FATAL_ERROR to WARNING with early return.
#
#   Cyrus Harrison, Wed Jan 19 12:56:45 PST 2022
#   Make sure `make install` will call docs build target, otherwise
#   make install can fail unless "make manuals" is called manually. 
#
#   Cyrus Harrison, Fri Feb 25 14:49:03 PST 2022
#   Add a `docs` cmake target that is an alais for `manuals`
#
#   Kathleen Biagas, Thu Mar 24, 2022
#   Use 'manuals.vcxproj' for building manuals during an install on Windows
#   with MSVC.
