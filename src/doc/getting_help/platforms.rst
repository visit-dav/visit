Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Supported platforms periodically change due to any of a number of factors outside of control of the VisIt_ project including demand, developer access, technology obsolescence, and majority stakeholder requirements.

The platforms upon which the majority of contributors regularly develop and run VisIt_ and for which the resources exist to provide *full support* are determined primarily by our `host organization <https://wci.llnl.gov>`_.
For these platforms, we are able to reproduce bugs, test bug-fixes, develop work-arounds and in general provide the highest quality support services.
These platforms are...

* These |fs*nix|
* Windows 7, 8 and 10
* macOS 10.15

We do make an effort to provide pre-compiled binaries as well as perform minimal testing for these |ps*nix|.
However, because we do not yet routinely develop or test on these platforms, we are not able to provide the same level of support.

Finally, for other platforms, :ref:`building <Building>` VisIt_ from sources is an option.
We do try to be responsive to issues building VisIt_ from sources.
