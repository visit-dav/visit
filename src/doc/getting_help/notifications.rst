Managing GitHub Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The VisIt_ project is maintained on GitHub.
Users needing support or even to just be notified of new releases need a (free) GitHub account to create and comment on discussions and issues and to watch for releases.

You will receive notifications from GitHub for...

* ...any activity *you initiate* (issue, discussion, pull request, etc.) 
* ...any activity *types* you choose to *watch*.
* ...when someone `@mentions you <https://github.blog/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/>`_.

In addition, GitHub provides controls for the types of activities for which you want to receive `notifications <https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications>`_.
For example, users can configure their `watch <https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository>`_ settings on the `main VisIt repository <https://github.com/visit-dav/visit>`_ to be notified only when new releases are made.

Every email generated by GitHub includes an ``unsubscribe`` link at the bottom to turn off notifications for the particular activity (issue, discussion, pull request, etc.) the email is associated with.

Be aware that if you unsubscribe from activity *you initiate* (e.g. submitting an issue), you may miss any follow-up discussion and/or resolution.
We will close, possibly without resolution, any issues or discussions awaiting follow-up for more than 21 days.
