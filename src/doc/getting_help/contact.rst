Methods of Contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Methods of contact for help differ in *requirements* and *privacy* level.
In addition, while we try to accommodate a variety of means of *initial contact*, anything requiring *ongoing dialog* must use only a *preferred* method of communication.
Please read about our :ref:`communication policies <supported_methods_of_contact>` for more details.

In general, **coverage** is during normal West Coast business hours, 8am-12pm and 1-5pm (GMT-8, San Francisco time zone), Monday through Friday excluding `LLNL holidays <https://supplychain.llnl.gov/poattach/pdf/llnl_holidays.pdf>`_.
**Response time** may be as much as four hours due to team member's multi-tasking among many responsibilities.

If you are so inclined, we welcome you to read more about the VisIt project's :ref:`Site Reliability Engineering <site_reliability_engineering>` processes to understand how we provide support.
