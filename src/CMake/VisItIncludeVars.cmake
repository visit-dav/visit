#*****************************************************************************
#  Purpose:  Sets up some Include vars for use with normal development builds
#            and building plugins against an installed version of VisIt.
#
#  Vars created:
#     VISIT_COMMON_INCLUDES:    used everywhere in VisIt
#     VISIT_DATABASE_INCLUDES:  used by database plugins
#     VISIT_OPERATOR_INCLUDES:  used by operator plugins
#     VISIT_PLOT_INCLUDES:      used by plot plugins
#
#  Modifications:
#     Removed most 'common' directories from VISIT_COMMON_INCLUDES, as they
#     are now handled by the CMake target 'visitcommon'.
#
#*****************************************************************************

# Set up easy to use includes for the common directory
