Notes related to the upgrade of putty to 0.78.
They changed their build system significantly, with no easy mechanism for only building plink.
So, the CMake build system was modified to only build plink.
A few source files needed modification in order for the build to work correctly in the context of VisIt's build.

To keep track of changes made to putty source and build file, the orignal files were copied and given a '.original' extension.
This was done in the hopes of making the next putty upgrade a bit simpler.
A quick comparison of the non '.original' file with the '.original' will reveal the changes needed by VisIt.

With this upgrade, it was decided to drop VisIt's support for unix-qtssh as no longer needed, so no attempt was made to modify that path through puttys files.


// Files that were modified for VisIt use:

CMakeLists.txt
defs.h
cmake/setup.cmake
crypto/CMakeLists.txt
ssh/CMakeLists.txt
ssh/userauth2-client.c
utils/buildinfo.c
windows/CMakeLists.txt
windows/qtsshmain.c  /* added, derived from windows/plink.c */

qtssh.h and qtssh.cpp are VisIt files and not part of the putty distro.

Files/directories part of the putty distro that aren't used by VisIt were removed.
