#    Added mpeg_encode.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Sep  9 07:28:58 PDT 2003

#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Nov  6 08:36:56 PST 2007
#    Removed references to prep, but keeping code in prep dir as per
#    Hank's request.
#

#    Removed 'silex' from SUBDIRS variable but kept actual silex directory
#    around for a while. This essentially removes it from builds but makes
#    it possible for people to easily build it if for some reasone they
#    still want to build this version. In fact, they should really be using
#    the silex in Silo distro as that has been kept up to date with various
#    changes to Silo library.
#

#    I added an engine-only build option.
