                      =====================================

This document contains instructions for installing VisIt on both Unix and
Windows systems.  The Unix installation instructions are first followed
by the Windows installation instructions.

Unix and Mac OS X:

1.  Run the visit-install script to install visit.  Note that it can
    create a new distribution directory or update an existing distribution.
    This is handled automatically.

        visit-install "version" "platform" "directory"

    where

        "version" will be 1.12.2 for the current distribution.

        "platform" will be one of the following:  aix, aix64, darwin-i386,
        darwin-ppc, linux-altix, linux-ellipse, linux_rhel3, linux-x86_64,
        linux-x86_64-ubuntu8 or linux-x86_64-fedora4 depending on the
        machine.  The one you use should match the name of the accompanying
        distribution file.

        "directory" is the directory you wish to install visit into.
        If the directory doesn't exist the script will create it.

    For example

        visit-install 1.12.2 linux_rhel3 /usr/local/visit

    will install the linux_rhel3, 1.12.2 version of visit in the directory
    "/usr/local/visit".  Note that you will need to have the file
    "visit1_12_2.linux_rhel3.tar.gz" present in the current directory for this
    to function properly.  You can install multiple binaries into the
    same directory.  For example, you could then execute

        visit-install 1.12.2 darwin-i386 /usr/local/visit

    to add a linux, 1.12.2 version of visit to the same directory.

2.  Add the bin directory below the installation directory
    (/usr/local/visit/bin in our example) to each user's search path.
    The best way to do this is to add it to the user's .cshrc file.
    The bin directory contains the visit script which starts VisIt.
    It can be run on many machines.  The script determines the type of
    machine it is running on and starts the appropriate executable.
    If visit were installed in the directory "/usr/local/visit",
    then the following commands would set your search path
    appropriately.

        cd
        echo "set path = ($path /usr/local/visit/bin)" >> .cshrc

    This completes the installation process for VisIt.

3.  If you are installing VisIt on a Linux system with an NVidia graphics
    card, we recommend using the latest driver.

Windows:

1.  Copy the file visit1.12.2.exe to your desktop.

2.  Double click on the visit1.12.2.exe icon to run the installer.

3.  Follow the directions provided by the installer.
