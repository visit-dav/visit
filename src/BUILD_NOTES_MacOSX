                         Building VisIt on MacOS X
                         =========================

   This document describes how to build VisIt on MacOS X under at least 10.4.x 
on Intel and 10.3.9 on PPC. Building a universal binary MacOS X, while similar,
has significant differences requiring special instructions. 
Most of the differences arise from how MacOS X provides support for compiling
and linking of multiple architectures. A good reference of the issues involved
is: http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2137.html. The creation of
universal binaries adds a significant degree of difficulty to the VisIt build.
For this reason only 2-way universal binaries will be considered in this
document. Some of the reasons for this complexity include:
1) MacOS X dynamic shared libraries use the .dylib extension. The later GNU
autotools, and libtool know about this, but the library must be built using 
these later versions. If the package is a few years old there's a good chance
it doesn't know how to build dynamic libraries for the Mac.
2) Universal binaries require gcc/g++-4.x. Quite a few of the third-party 
libraries are a few years old, and even though they use configure, they were
released before MacOS X and gcc-4.x.
3) The Intel Mac is not the same architecture as the PPC Mac. Some packages 
even if they do support the MacOS X, assume that MacOS X = PowerPC (32-bit
only). This gets even more complex, when 4-way universal binaries (ppc, i386,
ppc_64, and x86_64) are desired.
4) The configure file are created with older autoconf scripts which don't 
support either: Mac OS X, gcc-4.x, or cross-compiling. In the worse case
configure can't determine that a cross compile is required, and configure can't 
determine the target machines characteristics by running code the build machine.
5) The third-pary configure  doesn't support the building universal 
binaries. Problems develop when configure determines the endianness or word
size for compiling. Universal binaries must make this determination during the 
compile. Each architecture in a universal binary requires it's own separate
compile.

Supporting and building universal binaries requires that the PowerPC Mac be
running at least MacOS X10.3.9, and the Intel Mac run MacOS X10.4.x (Tiger).
This document used C/C++ compiler (gcc-4.0.1) from Xcode 2.4.1.

VisIt relies on several external libraries which must be built and installed
prior to building VisIt.  This document provides detailed step by step
instructions for building VisIt and each of the dependent libraries.  The
instructions have been designed so that you can cut and paste most of the
commands needed to build the libraries and VisIt from this file into your
shell prompt.

The public version of VisIt has been built with the above listed versions
of the libraries, so it is known to work properly with those versions.  For
all the packages except VTK and Qt, you can probably use newer versions of the
packages and VisIt should work properly. For VTK, you must use the 5.0.0c
distribution provided on the VisIt Web site, because extensions/fixes have been
added to the VTK-5.x library. The version of Qt used to build VisIt on MacOS X
must be greater than or equal to 3.3.6 to support gcc-4.x and Intel Mac. For 
Mesa, you must build a mangled version of Mesa.  

Most of the third party libraries necessary to build VisIt are available for
download from ftp://ftp.llnl.gov/pub/visit/3rd_party.  It is suggested that
you start there and then go to the "For More Information" web sites for
any remaining libraries.

It is essential that you build all the dependent packages and VisIt using
the same c++ compiler or you will encounter linking problems because different
compilers or different versions of the same compiler may use different name
mangling schemes. For MacOS X, we recommend using at least Xcode 2.4.1.


==============================================================================
Crucial linker flags for dynamic library
==============================================================================

-install_name        The -install_name flag inserts the name of the library
                     into the actual dylib file. Normally if you do not
		     provide this flag, the path where you built the library is
		     inserted into the dylib file and applications that link
		     with the dylib look for it in the path stored in the dylib,
		     which easily leads to the library not being found. In order
		     to make sure that the system can find the dylib file used
		     by your application, make sure you build dylib files so
		     their installed name is relative to the executable.
		   
		     For VisIt, which has a bin directory and a separate lib
		     directory for libraries, we set the installation name like
		     this:
		     
		     -install_name,@executable_path/../lib/libfoo.dylib.
		     
		     The above example makes sure that applications in bin that
		     linked with libfoo.dylib look for it in ../lib instead of
		     a hardcoded path.
		 

==============================================================================
install_name_tool
==============================================================================

This tool allows us to change information about where an application looks for 
libraries or what these libraries are called. By changing the internal file
information we can use relative paths to the 3rd party libraries, and not
relaying on DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (or LD_LIBRARY_PATH) environment variables.
For example the multithreaded version of Qt, replace libqt.3.dylib with 
libqt-mt.3.dylib, the build scripts all assume libqt.dylib (or simply -lqt).
Assume we must update both the library and an executable so that they know 
where the qt library can be found. This is where the install_name_tool 
command-line tool comes in handy. For the Qt library:
    cp libqt-mt.3.dylib libqt.dylib
    install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../lib/libqt.dylib \
        libqt.dylib
    
And for included libraries, and the executable:
    install_name_tool \
        -change libqt-mt.3.dylib \
        @executable_path/../lib/libqt.dylib \
        demo
    
The "@executable_path" symbol should to be typed as is; it must not be replaced 
by the real path to the executable on your machine.

==============================================================================
otool
==============================================================================

MacOS X has a utility called otool that allows you to examine the contents of
a dynamic library or an executable. This tool performs function similar to the
ldd tool (used in Linux). Otool is very handy for determining the names and
locations of the dynamic library's needed for this binary. Here are the most 
useful options for otool:

# Print all of the dependent libraries
otool -L libfoo.dylib

==============================================================================
Creating dynamic libraries
==============================================================================

Use gxx/g++ in place of the link editor on the specified input object files to
creates the dynamic library.  The library's name  is specified  by  output  
(the argument to the -o flag).  The input object files may be in any correct
format that contains universal object files, or plain object files. The options:
-install_name, -compatibility_version, current_version, -undefined dynamic_lookup, 
and -header-pad_max_install_names must be embedded in the -Wl, option for 
passage
to the linker.

Example:
gcc -dynamiclib -o libfoo.dylib src/*.o \
-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names,-undefined,dynamic_lookup,\
-compatibility_version,2.0,-current_version,2.2.1,\
-install_name,@executable_path/../lib/libfoo.dylib

Example for universal binary:
gcc -dynamiclib -o libfoo.dylib src/*.o \
-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk,\
-headerpad_max_install_names,-undefined,dynamic_lookup,\
-compatibility_version,2.0,-current_version,2.2.1,\
-install_name,@executable_path/../lib/libfoo.dylib \
 -arch ppc -arch i386

==============================================================================
Creating dynamic libraries from static libraries
==============================================================================

Using Apple's custom libtool command takes the specified input object files and
creates dynamic a library for use with the link editor, ld(1).  The library's 
name  is specified  by  output  (the argument to the -o flag).  The input object
files may be in any correct format that contains universal object files,
archives, object files. The options: -install_name, -compatibility_version, 
current_version, -multiply_defined, and -header-pad_max_install_names are
commonly used.

Example:
libtool -o libfoo.dylib-i386 -dynamic libfoo.a -lSystem \
-twolevel_namespace -undefined dynamic_lookup -arch_only i386 \
-headerpad_max_install_names \
-install_name @executable_path/../lib/libfoo.dylib \
-compatibility_version 1.0 -current_version 1.1.5

==============================================================================
Building an application that can run on multiple versions of MacOS X
==============================================================================

By default, the linker on MacOS X will resolve all system library dependencies
such that the final linked binary file will depend on a particular version of
the system libraries. For example, this prevents you from building on 
MacOS X 10.4 and running your application on MacOS X 10.3. As of MacOS X 10.3,
there is a special linker flag, called -undefined, that allows system library
dependencies to be left undefined during the link step. There is 
also an environment variable called MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET that can be 
set to tell the linker which versions of the system libraries to expect. 
Setting the  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable and using the
-undefined linker flag will help your compiled application run on more than
one version of MacOS X.

To make sure that when you build an application on MacOS X 10.3, it can also 
run on MacOS X 10.4 and beyond, you should set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
environment variable before you build your application.

Example:
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3

You should also add the -headerpad_max_install_names to your LDFLAGS in your
Makefile, this option allows renaming of the install name stored in the
dynamic library file.

These are the default linker flags for the Mac used by VisIt.
Example:
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup,-headerpad_max_install_names"

==============================================================================
Configuring universal binaries on MacOS X
==============================================================================

The first approach is to simply have configure build a universal binary, by
passing in the appropriate CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables. 
This isdone simply by running:
./configure --prefix=${VISITPATH}/foo CXXFLAGS=\
 "-O -g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc" \
 CFLAGS="-O -g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc" \
 LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc"  --disable-dependency-tracking
 
The --disable-dependency-tracking option to configure causes it to not use gcc's
built-in dependency generation code, which does not work with multiple -arch
targets.

This is the easiest means of generating universal binaries, but unfortunatly
most older configure scripts will not support this feature.

With MacOS X 10.5 a 4-way universial binary can be created by adding:
-arch ppc_64 -arch x86_64 to the flags.

==============================================================================
Universal binaries on MacOS X by merging multiple builds
==============================================================================

If the third-party library does care about byte order, word size, or pointer
size, and configure supports cross-compiling. Multiple invocations of 
configure/make will generate architecture based objects, that can in turn can 
be merged into universal binaries. Not all open source projects follow these
convensions. The lipo command is used to merge the multiple builds.

In the worse case (configu doen't support cross-compiling) multiple machines
will be needed to generate the architecture based objects.

On both an Intel- and PowerPC-based Macintosh, configure and build the program
as follows:
./configure --prefix=${VISITPATH}/foo
make

Copy the resultant libfoo.dylib programs to a single machine; for example, into
/tmp on a PowerPC-based Macintosh, with the names libfoo.dylib-intel and
libfoo.dylib-ppc, respectively. Then, use the lipo command to combine the two:

lipo -create libfoo.dylib-intel libfoo.dylib-ppc -output libfoo.dylib

As before, the file command can verify the file contents:
$ file libfoo.dylib
libfoo.dylib: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures
libfoo.dylib (for architecture ppc):        Mach-O dynamically linked shared
library ppc
libfoo.dylib (for architecture i386):       Mach-O dynamically linked shared
library i386

The same procedure as above applies to executables.

==============================================================================
Support libraries
==============================================================================

Most of the instructions in this document are for building the various support
libraries that VisIt depends on as prebound dynamic libraries. Few of the
libraries that VisIt uses actually have support in their make system for
producing universal binary libraries so it is imperative that you follow the
directions. The following procedure used an Intel-Mac as the primary build
machine, also a PowerPC-Mac was required to build a few of the 3-party
libraries that didn't support cross compiling.

Before building VisIt or any of its support libraries, you need to create a
"visit" directory in which the support libraries will be installed. We also 
create a file that contains the path so we can use that in some of the
instructions later on.

mkdir visit
echo `pwd`/visit > visitpath
export VISITPATH="`pwd`/visit"

Also, note when these instructions indicate that a library's source code must
be replaced or modified. VTK requires some source code modifications before
compilation. Since the source exists within VisIt's source code directory, 
take this opportunity to unzip VisIt's source code distribution and set an
environment variable that will be used to identify VisIt's source code 
directory.

# Make sure that you build a version of VisIt that can run on MacOS X 10.3
# and later.
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3

==============================================================================
Building Qt as a universal library
==============================================================================

Qt actually builds as a prebound dynamic library but we need to make sure
that it sets an install_name that is relative to our VisIt executables. The
Qt-4.x version promises to support universal builds, until then you'll
need to build twice then lipo to combine the two build.

# Unzip the Qt source
tar zxf qt-mac-free-3.3.8.tar.gz
cd qt-mac-free-3.3.8

#
export QTDIR=$(pwd)
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure -thread -platform macx-g++ --prefix=$VISITPATH/qt
make

# Install headers Qt
make install

# Change the dynamic install names
cd lib
rm libqt.dylib
cp libqt-mt.3.3.8.dylib libqt.dylib
install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../lib/libqt.dylib libqt.dylib
rm libqui.dylib
cp libqui.1.0.0.dylib libqui.dylib
install_name_tool -change libqt-mt.3.dylib @executable_path/../lib/libqt.dylib \
libqui.dylib
install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../lib/libqui.dylib libqui.dylib
cp libqt.dylib libqui.dylib $VISITPATH/qt/lib
cd ../..

==============================================================================
Building Mesa as a universal library
==============================================================================		    

Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of
OpenGL.  It is used for performing off-screen rendering.
I'm using the 6.5.2 version in place of the VisIt third-party 5.0
because of better support for universal binaries.
This distribution however would not build as 2-way universal binary without
building on separate machines.

#
# Build Mesa
#
tar zxf MesaLib-6.5.2.tar.gz
cd Mesa-6.5.2

#
# Special instructions for building Mesa on MacOS X
#
# The darwin target for building Mesa assumes that you want to build Mesa
# with support for X11. This is not what we want to do for the version of
# Mesa that we'll use for VisIt since we only want offscreen rendering.

# Remove the X11 libraries, and change GL_LIB so it will build a 
# library called libMesaGL.dylib instead of libGL.dylib. Finally, 
# edit GLU_LIB_DEPS so it uses -lMesaGL instead of -lGL.
vi configs/default
#    Change:

#
# Remove all X include files and libraries from the darwin target. Also add

==============================================================================
Building CMake in order to build VTK
==============================================================================

CMake is a cross-platform make system used to build VTK. Before building VTK,
we must build CMake. The VisIt third-party contains the older cmake-2.2.3 
It didn't build for me so I'm using the more recent cmake-2.4.5.

tar zxf cmake-2.4.5.tar.gz
cd cmake-2.4.5
env CXXFLAGS="" CFLAGS="" ./bootstrap
make
cd ..

==============================================================================
Building VTK as a set of prebound dynamic libraries
==============================================================================

VTK is an object oriented library for visualizing 3D data.  VisIt uses it
for all its visualization functionality. Follow the directions listed below
to build VTK.  If you have any problems building or installing VTK, read the
VTK/README.html file included in the VTK distribution for more information.
This distribution however would not build as 2-way universal binary without
building on separate machines.

tar zxf vtk-5.0.0c.tar.gz
cd VTK

Source code and build modifications:
====================================

The above VTK distribution must be modified a little to support features that
VisIt needs in order to run properly. For example, VisIt requires VTK to be built
with support for mangled mesa in order to support offscreen rendering. VisIt
uses offscreen rendering to save images, do scalable rendering in parallel, and
to render images when the CLI is run in -nowin mode. VTK cannot be built with 
mangled mesa support on MacOS X without some modifications to its source code 
and build system. Follow each of the next instructions before building VTK to
ensure that you produce VTK libraries that meet VisIt's needs.

  if (!strcmp("CarbonOpenGL",rl))
    {
    if(strcmp(vtkclassname, "vtkTextMapper") == 0)
      {
#if defined(VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA)
      if ( vtkImagingFactory::UseMesaClasses )
        {
        return vtkMesaFreeTypeTextMapper::New();
        }
#endif
      return vtkOpenGLFreeTypeTextMapper::New();
      }
    if(strcmp(vtkclassname, "vtkImageMapper") == 0)
      {
#if defined(VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA)
      if ( vtkImagingFactory::UseMesaClasses )
        {
        return vtkMesaImageMapper::New();
        }
#endif
      return vtkOpenGLImageMapper::New();
      }
    if(strcmp(vtkclassname, "vtkPolyDataMapper2D") == 0)
      {
#if defined(VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA)
      if ( vtkImagingFactory::UseMesaClasses )
        {
        return vtkMesaPolyDataMapper2D::New();
        }
#endif
      return vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper2D::New();
      }
    }
#endif

You may have noticed that we don't do anything in VTK to preclude the use of
vtkCarbonRenderWindow, even though it cannot support Mesa. We register an
override of vtkCarbonRenderWindow later in VisIt's visit_vtk library that
forces VTK to create one of VisIt's vtkOSMesaRenderWindow objects instead
of creating vtkCarbonRenderWindow objects. This allows us to do offscreen
rendering in MacOS X without having to rewrite vtkCarbonRenderWindow.


Configuring VTK:
================

../cmake-2.4.5/bin/ccmake .

The above ccmake program is a menu for configuring VTK. Follow these steps to 
configure VTK and generate its makefiles. You must perform these steps before
you can build VTK.

1. First, press "c" for configure.
2. When it is finished, press "t" for advanced options, and change the 
   options listed below:

    Option                             Value
    =================================================
    SHARED_LIBS                        ON
    BUILD_TESTING                      OFF
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                   Release
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE            -O3 -fno-common
    CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE              -O3 -fno-common
    CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE     -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names
    CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE  -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names
    CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE  -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names,\
-compatibility_version,5.0,-current_version,5.0.0
    CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE             TRUE
    VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA              OFF
    VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA               ON

3. Type "c" to make ccmake configure. When it is done there are more options 
   to fill in. The use of $VISITPATH in this case is for illustration purposes
   only. Since you are inside of ccmake, substitute the actual value for
   $VISITPATH instead of using the $VISTIPATH environment variable.

   Option                              Value
   =================================================
   MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR            $VISITPATH/mesa/include
   MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY                $VISITPATH/mesa/lib/libMesaGL.dylib
   MANGLED_OSMESA_INCLUDE              $VISITPATH/mesa/include
   MANGLED_OSMESA_LIB                  $VISITPATH/mesa/lib/libOSMesa.dylib

4. Type "c" to configure
5. Type "g" to generate and quit

Building Python as a dynamic library
===============================================================================

Python is a powerful, free scripting language that is used to drive VisIt's
viewer when running VisIt without a GUI. Python is cross platform and runs on
many UNIXes as well as MS Windows and other platforms. VisIt can be configured
to run without Python if scripting features are not desired.  Follow the
directions listed below to build Python.  If you have any problems building
or installing Python, read the README file in the Python distribution for more
information.
Python currently can't be built as a 4-way universal binary, because it
depends on the Carbon framework, which is currently 32-bit, a 2-way build
appears to supported now.

tar zxf Python-2.5.tgz

Building HDF5 as a dynamic library (optional)
===============================================================================

HDF5 is a data storage library that allows you to efficiently write large
volumes of structured storage to a disk file. VisIt can technically be built
without support for HDF5 so it is an optional, but recommended, package. Though
it is optional, we build it before the Silo library because the Silo library
should be built with support for HDF5 when possible. If you don't want to build
HDF5, you can skip this section but you will have to take care that you do not
attempt to build Silo with support for HDF5. HDF5 uses configure to
determine endianness and configure doesn't support cross-compiling. Therefore
HDF5 meeded to be built on both an Intel machine and a PPC machine. These 
resulting libraries are then merged together to get a universal binary.

tar zxf hdf5-1.6.5.tar.gz
cd hdf5-1.6.5

HDF5 need more recent configure, and libtool configuration. I used the latest
releases from GNU for m4, autoconf, automake, and libtool. Run autoreconf
to rebuild the GUN build system.

autoreconf -vif

# Build a library for each architecure, on the PPC machine:
./configure --prefix=$VISITPATH/hdf5 CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-common" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names"

# make will bomb, but gets far enough
make
# Install HDF5 headers
make install

# Create and install dynamic library

Building Mili as a dynamic library  (optional)
===============================================================================

Mili is a database file format library for finite element codes like ls-dyna.
VisIt has a database reader for this popular LLNL engineering database file
format. Mili file format support is optional and is not required for
VisIt to run. Mili doesn't require building on 2 different machines.

==============================================================================
Building HDF4 as a dynamic library  (optional)
==============================================================================

HDF4 is a data storage library that lets you write large volumes of data to 
disk files and it is the predecessor of HDF5. Like most of the other libraries
mentioned so far, HDF4 does not have a make target to produce a dynamic
library. In fact, its make target for MacOS X produces a static library. Follow
the instructions below for creating universal dynamic libraries. 
This distribution however would not build as 2-way universal binary without
building on separate machines.

HDF4 requires some external software libries, SZIP, ZLIB. and JPEG. ZLIB is
built in to MacOS, JPEG was created during the VTK step above, and SZIP
will be ignored.

# Unpack HDF4
tar zxf HDF4.2r1.tar.gz
cd HDF4.2r1

vi configure
# Note that as of VTK 5.0, the names in the VTK

Building NetCDF as a dynamic library  (optional)
==============================================================================

NetCDF is a scientific data storage library that lets you write platform-
independent binary files. The build system doesn't allow for a universal

Building Exodus II as a dynamic library  (optional)
===============================================================================
EXODUS II is a model developed to store and retrieve data for finite element 
analyses. It is used for preprocessing (problem definition), postprocessing 
(results visualization), as well as code to code data transfer. An EXODUS II
data file is a random access, machine independent, binary file that is written
and read via C, C++, or Fortran library routines which comprise the Application 
Programming Interface. (exodusII is based on netcdf). I needed to do a machine
merge in order to get a universal binary.

The EXODUS II library depends on the customized NetCDF library, from above.

Building Silo as a dynamic library  (optional)
===============================================================================

Silo is a self-describing, machine-independent scientific file format.
Silo is one of the file formats supported by VisIt.  Follow the directions
listed below to build Silo.  If you have any problems building or installing
Silo, read the INSTALL_NOTES file in the SILO distribution for more
information.

Note that these instructions assume that Silo will be built with HDF5 support.
If you build Silo with HDF5 support then you must have first built HDF5 using
the instructions provided earlier in this document. If you don't want to build
Silo with HDF5 support, replace the --with-hdf5=... with --without-hdf5.
The library segment offsets used assume that Silo will be built with support
for HDF5. I needed to do a machine merge in order to get a universal binary,
because the endianness and word size is determined in configure.

Building CFITSIO as a dynamic library (Optional)
===============================================================================

CFITSIO is a library for reading FITS files. FITS stands for `Flexible Image 
Transport System' and is the standard astronomical data format endorsed by 
both NASA and the IAU. FITS is much more than an image format (such as JPG 
or GIF) and is primarily designed to store scientific data sets consisting 
of multi-dimensional arrays (1-D spectra, 2-D images or 3-D data cubes) and
2-dimensional tables containing rows and columns of data.
Cfitsio uses an old autoconf, only makeing a static library.
I could build a 2-way universal binary.

#
# Build CFITSIO
#
tar zxf cfitsio3006.tar.gz
cd cfitsio

#
env CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-common" LDFLAGS="-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names" \
./configure --prefix=$VISITPATH/cfitsio/3006

make
# Build a dynamic library
libtool -o libcfitsio.dylib -dynamic libcfitsio.a -lSystem \
-twolevel_namespace -undefined dynamic_lookup -headerpad_max_install_names \
-install_name @executable_path/../lib/libcfits.dylib \
-compatibility_version 3.0 -current_version 3.006

# Install.
mkdir $VISITPATH/cfitsio
make install
cd ..

Building VisIt
===============================================================================

VisIt uses GNU's autoconf system to provide platform independence when
building VisIt in a UNIX environment. Autoconf creates a script called
configure that tests your system for various libraries and programs required
to build VisIt.  Follow the directions listed below to build VisIt.
More information about building VisIt follows after that.

#
# Unzipping VisIt's source code distribution
#
tar zxf visit070330.tar.gz
cd visit070330

#
# HDF5 and Silo
#
If you built the Silo library with support for HDF5 using the instructions in
this document then create a symbolic link to it from the Silo directory so 
VisIt's configure script will find it..

ln -s $VISITPATH/hdf5/lib/libhdf5.dylib $VISITPATH/silo/lib/libhdf5.dylib

#
# Configure VisIt
# The example Mac configurations are config-site/tread.llnl.gov.conf and
# config-site/tread.local.conf
#
cd config-site
echo VISITHOME=`cat ../../visitpath` > `hostname`.conf
cat Template.conf >> `hostname`.conf

# If VisIt failed to configure properly, check the contents of the
# `hostname`.conf file to make sure that it points to the libraries that
# you build. You can look at tread.local.conf, which is a configuration file
