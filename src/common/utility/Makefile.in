#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 14:02:09 PDT 2001
#    Made it create a shared library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 27 13:50:06 PDT 2001
#    Made it remove libutility on a make clean.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:33 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Sep 17 10:44:49 PDT 2001
#    Added array_ref_ptr.h
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Feb 14 15:04:07 PST 2002
#    Split part of Utility into VTKUtility
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 27 14:12:37 PDT 2002
#    Removed VTKUtility entirely.  Its functionality is now split between
#    the SiloDump operator plugin or the Silo database plugin.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Sep 24 09:44:49 PDT 2002
#    Remove ref_ptr.C, add void_ref_ptr.C
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Feb 16 11:23:34 PDT 2005
#    Added top level VisIt include.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Mar 23 10:39:47 PDT 2006
#    Added AtomicProperties.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Aug  2 19:58:44 PDT 2006
#    Added MRUCache_test.C
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:33:06 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the NOT_DISTRIB variable.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Oct  9 14:08:56 EDT 2007
#    Added dependency on the library for the test programs.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Mon Apr 14 15:41:21 PDT 2008
#    Made BJHash fully inlined
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Mon Apr 21 19:53:26 PDT 2008
#    Test commit with tabs, here
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Mon Apr 21 19:53:26 PDT 2008
#    Removed the tabs inserted above 
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed May  6 08:41:19 PDT 2009
#    Remove reference to $INCLUDE, which is not a variable that our configure
#    script uses.  It was working in most places, because it was not defined,
#    but TACC's machines define INCLUDE as an environment variable.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Jun 30 19:57:39 MDT 2009
#    Add define for proper symbol export.
