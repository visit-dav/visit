#    Made it remove libutility on a make clean.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:33 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Sep 17 10:44:49 PDT 2001
#    Added array_ref_ptr.h
#

#    Split part of Utility into VTKUtility
#
