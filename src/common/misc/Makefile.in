#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug  4 16:42:44 PDT 2000
#    Changed source listing to use SRC=$(OBJ:.o=.C).  This allows parsing
#    of this Makefile.in for object files inside configure.
#    Cleaned up some stuff, too.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Nov 17 16:25:17 PST 2000
#    Moved the files in this directory into common/comm/.  Moved VisItException
#    into this directory.  Added DebugStream and Init.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sat Mar 10 17:32:48 PST 2001
#    Added TimingsManager.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Apr 27 15:34:55 PDT 2001
#    Added PTY.[Ch]
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 14:02:09 PDT 2001
#    Made it create a shared library.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:57 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:37:49 PDT 2002
#    Unified include directories.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:34:38 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the NOT_DISTRIB variable.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Sat Nov 22 16:48:20 MST 2008
#    Added Environment
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 10 16:12:30 PDT 2009
#    I moved some code from utility into InstallationFunctions.C
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Apr 21 14:37:24 PDT 2009
#    Added DebugStreamFull.[Ch] (really a rename of DebugStream.[Ch])
