# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Nov 24 12:31:20 PST 2004
#    Created.  Took mostly from the old parser library.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Jan 4 17:01:46 PST 2005
#    Added additional libraries to the link line so it links on MacOS X.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jun  5 17:34:25 EDT 2007
#    Renamed the TESTOBJ1 to a slightly more standard TESTOBJ to play better
#    with automatic dependencies.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:36:20 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the NOT_DISTRIB variable.
