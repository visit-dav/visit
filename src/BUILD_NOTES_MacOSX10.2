                  Building VisIt on MacOS X 10.2 (Jaguar)
                     ================================

   This document describes how to build VisIt on MacOS X10.2 (Jaguar). 
Building on MacOS X10.2, while similar enough to MacOS X10.3 and other 
versions of UNIX but there are enough differences to warrant these 
special instructions.  Most of the differences arise from how MacOS X 
provides support for advanced linking options such as prebinding, which
helps applications launch faster. We build VisIt and all of its support
libraries with prebinding enabled because it substantially improves VisIt's
startup time on MacOS X. Unfortunately, prebinding introduces a lot of
complexity with respect to building VisIt's support libraries because 
they each have varying degrees of support for MacOS X. In fact, only Qt 
has built-in support for prebinding. To enable prebinding for all of the 
other support libraries, follow the instructions in this document for 
building each library before finally building VisIt.

MacOS X10.2.8 is lowest version of MacOS that I've successfully been able 
to build VisIt on. The MacOS X10.2 build differs substantually from the
MacOS 10.3 build, hence this the need for these build notes.

VisIt relies on several external libraries which must be built and installed
prior to building VisIt.  This document provides detailed step by step
instructions for building VisIt and each of the dependent libraries.  The
instructions have been designed so that you can cut and paste most of the
commands needed to build the libraries and VisIt from this file into your
shell prompt.

The public version of VisIt has been built with the above listed versions
of the libraries, so it is known to work properly with those versions.  For
all the packages except VTK and Qt, you can probably use newer versions of the
packages and VisIt should work properly.  For Mesa, you must build a mangled
version of Mesa.  The distribution provided has already been set up to build
a mangled version so no additional work is required if you use it.  For VTK,
you must use the October 28, 2003 distribution provided. The version of Qt used 
to build VisIt on MacOS X must be greater than or equal to 3.2. CIAC Bulletin 
O-201 recommend at least version 3.3.3, to aviod flaws in BMP, GIF, XPM, and 
JPEG decoders may cause Qt to crash. Qt switched over to the new segment 
addressing conversions which obsoletes the old BUILD_NOTES_MacOSX notes.

It is essential that you build all the dependent packages and VisIt using
the same c++ compiler or you will encounter linking problems because different
compilers or different versions of the same compiler may use different name
mangling schemes. For MacOS X10.2 (Jaguar), we recommend using g++ 3.3, this 
will require upgrading to MacOS X10.2.8, and the installation of the August 2003
gcc Update from the Apple ADC site. In theory you can use MacOS X10.3 and
xCode 10.2 SDK in the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 mode to cross-compile a
backward compatible VisIt. In reality, this can't be done, it doesn't work!
Apple changed the /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib, between 10.2, and 10.3, adding
wide character support. The resulting 10.3 compiled binary will fail to run
on 10.2 because of undefined symbols referencing wcslen, wmemcpy, and the
like. Hence, if you want 10.2 compitabile binaries, you must use a 10.2
system to build them.

I haven't gotten around to testing this yet, but
I understand that these extra prebinding steps will no longer be necessary.
Apple has improved the 10.3.4 and later dynamic linker such that prebinding
is no longer necessary. You should be able to test this using:

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3
export LD_PREBIND=1
export LD_TWOLEVEL_NAMESPACE=1
export LD_SEG_ADDR_TABLE=/path/to/seg/addr/table

==============================================================================
Crucial linker flags for prebinding a library or application
==============================================================================

-prebind             The -prebind flag should be used for applications and
                     libraries that you want to be prebound. Put the -prebind
		     flag in your LDFLAGS or wherever you provide arguments
		     to the linker. Prebinding allows your application to
		     start faster because all symbols are already resolved
		     and resolution is not required when the application is
		     launched. Furthermore, since prebinding requires that
		     all libraries used in the application have distinct, non-
		     overlapping memory ranges, the linker can compute
		     appropriate relocation offsets at link time.

-twolevel_namespace  A two level namespace is what's commonly used on most
                     platforms but MacOS X initially came with just a flat
		     namespace, which prevented duplicate symbols in the
		     same application. A two level namespace allows duplicates
		     and is more forgiving, though possibly error prone if
		     there are multiple symbols with the same name. Two-level
		     symbol resolution also takes a little longer.

-install_name        The -install_name flag inserts the name of the library
                     into the actual dylib file. Normally if you do not
		     provide this flag, the path where you built the library is
		     inserted into the dylib file and applications that link
		     with the dylib look for it in the path stored in the dylib,
		     which easily leads to the library not being found. In order
		     to make sure that the system can find the dylib file used
		     by your application, make sure you build dylib files so
		     their installed name is relative to the executable.
		   
		     For VisIt, which has a bin directory and a separate lib
		     directory for libraries, we set the installation name like
		     this:
		     
		     -install_name,@executable_path/../lib/libfoo.dylib.
		     
		     The above example makes sure that applications in bin that
		     linked with libfoo.dylib look for it in ../lib instead of
		     a hardcoded path.
		 
-seg1addr            The -seg1addr flag tells the linker where the first segment
                     of your library should start in memory. Prebinding is not
		     enabled unless all of your libraries and your application
		     that uses them have memory ranges that do not overlap at
		     all. Computing the segment address for a complex project
		     like VisIt can be tricky and Makefile tricks are required
		     if you want the offset to be computed on the fly,
		     determined by the sizes of your libraries as they are built.
		     To specify the starting segment address, do this:
		     
		     -Wl,-seg1addr,0xB2000000

                     Look at VisIt's linkedit.py and configure.in scripts to
		     see how to compute the segment offset on the fly using
		     autoconf and Makefiles.

==============================================================================
Segment offset
==============================================================================

The initial segment offset for VisIt's support libraries begins at 0xB29F2000,
right after Qt's ending address. The memory addresses used in this document
reflect the sizes of the libraries as they were built at the time of VisIt 1.3.3
We chose segment offsets that pack the libraries into a fairly contiguous
block of memory so no libraries interfere with each other.

==============================================================================
otool
==============================================================================

MacOS X has a utility called otool that allows you to examine the contents of
a dynamic library or an executable. Otool is very handy for determining whether
a dynamic library was actually built with prebinding. Here are the most useful
options for otool:

# Print the Mach header. If the library is prebound, it will have the word
# PREBOUND in the output. If the output does not contain PREBOUND then you
# need to make changes to your library and relink until it is prebound because
# unless an application and *all* of its dependent libraries are prebound,
# it cannot use prebinding.
otool -hv libfoo.dylib

# Print all of the library dependencies
otool -hvL libfoo.dylib

==============================================================================
Support libraries
==============================================================================

Most of the instructions in this document are for building the various support
libraries that VisIt depends on as prebound dynamic libraries. Few of the
libraries that VisIt uses actually have support in their make system for
producing prebound dynamic libraries so it is imperative that you follow the
directions or VisIt will not be prebound. Remember that you can always use the
otool command to check whether a library or executable is prebound.

Before building VisIt or any of its support libraries, you need to create a
"visit" directory in which the support libraries will be installed. We also 
create file that contains the path so we can use that in some of the 
instructions later on.

mkdir visit
echo `pwd`/visit > visitpath
export VISITPATH="`pwd`/visit"
export LD_PREBIND
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2

==============================================================================
Building Qt as a set of prebound dynamic libraries
==============================================================================

Qt actually builds as a prebound dynamic library but we need to make sure
that it sets an install_name that is relative to our VisIt executables.

# Build Qt 3.3.3 for MacOS X
tar -zxf qt-mac-free-3.3.3.tar.gz
cd qt-mac-free-3.3.3
export QTDIR=`pwd`
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure -thread
make


# Qt built but we need to change it a little.
cd src
vi Makefile
# Modify -install_name @executable_path/../lib/libqt.dylib in LFLAGS and save
rm ../lib/libqt*
make
cd ..

# Install Qt
mkdir $VISITPATH/qt

cp include/*.h $VISITPATH/qt/include
cp include/private/*.h $VISITPATH/qt/include/private
cp lib/libqt-mt.3.3.3.dylib $VISITPATH/qt/lib/libqt.dylib
cd ..

==============================================================================
Building Mesa as a set of prebound dynamic libraries
==============================================================================		    

Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of
OpenGL.  It is used for performing off-screen rendering.

#
# Build Mesa
#
tar -zxf MesaLib-6.0.1.tar.gz
cd Mesa-6.0.1

#
# Special instructions for building Mesa on MacOS X
#
# The darwin target for building Mesa assumes that you want to build Mesa
# with support for X11. This is not what we want to do for the version of
# Mesa that we'll use for VisIt since we only want offscreen rendering.
#
# 1. Edit Make-config remove all X include files and libraries from
#    the darwin target. Also add -DUSE_MGL_NAMESPACE to the CFLAGS and
#    CCFLAGS so a mangled version of Mesa will be built. Next, change
#    GL_LIB so it will build a library called libMesaGL.dylib instead of
#    libGL.dylib. Change summary:
#       "GL_LIB = libMesaGL.dylib" \
#       "GLU_LIB = libMesaGLU.dylib" \
#       "CFLAGS = -DUSE_MGL_NAMESPACE -O3 -fPIC -fno-common -ffast-math \
#       "CXXFLAGS = -DUSE_MGL_NAMESPACE -O3 -fPIC -fno-common -ffast-math \
#       "GL_LIB_DEPS = -Wl,-seg1addr,0xB29F2000,-install_name,
#@executable_path/../lib/libMesaGL.dylib,-compatibility_version,1.5.0,
#-current_version,1.5.0 -lm -lpthread" \
#       "OSMESA_LIB_DEPS = -Wl,-seg1addr,0xB2C54000,-install_name,
#@executable_path/../lib/libOSMesa.dylib,-compatibility_version,1.5.0,
#-current_version,1.5.0 $(TOP)/lib/libMesaGL.dylib" \
#       "GLU_LIB_DEPS = $(TOP)/lib/libMesaGL.dylib" \
#       "GLW_LIB_DEPS = $(TOP)/lib/libMesaGL.dylib" \
#       "APP_LIB_DEPS = -L$(TOP)/lib -lglut -lMesaGLU -lMesaGL \
#-framework OpenGL -lm" 
# 2. Open bin/mklib and look for an case block that checks flags and add
#       -W*)          DEPS="$DEPS $1";;
#    in the Darwin part of the next case statement change FLAGS from:
#         FLAGES="-dynamiclib -multiply_defined suppress" 
#    to:
#         FLAGS="-dynamiclib -prebind -twolevel_namespace"
#
#    The additions above will cause the two modified libraries to be built
#    as prebound dynamic libraries, which will help reduce VisIt's start
#    time.
# 3. Open src/mesa/Makefile.X11
#    GL_LIB_NAME = libMesaGL
#    OSMESA_LIB_NAME = libOSMesa
#    and remove all of the source code files from
#    the DRIVER_SOURCES variable so it is defined as:
#    DRIVER_SOURCES = 
#
# ** Note - After you start building Mesa with these changes, it will fail
#           after successfully building libMesaGL.dylib and libOSMesa.dylib.
#           This is okay since those are the only libraries we want.
#           Continue on to building VTK.
#

#
# Build Mesa by typing in the Mesa-6.0.1 directory.
#
make darwin

#
# Install Mesa
#
mkdir $VISITPATH/mesa
mkdir $VISITPATH/mesa/{include,lib}

cd ..

Building CMake in order to build VTK
==============================================================================

CMake is a cross-platform make system used to build VTK. Before building VTK,
we must build CMake

tar -zxf cmake-2.0.3.tar.gz
cd cmake-2.0.3
./bootstrap
make
cd ..

==============================================================================
Building VTK as a set of prebound dynamic libraries
==============================================================================

VTK is an object oriented library for visualizing 3D data.  VisIt uses it
for all its visualization functionality. Follow the directions listed below
to build VTK.  If you have any problems building or installing VTK, read the
VTK/README.html file included in the VTK distribution for more information.

VTK does not provide targets for building prebound shared libraries. Rather than
change VTK's build process permanently, which I did not see how to do since I am
a CMake novice, I chose to edit the Makefiles generated by CMake after VTK was
built. I needed the size for all of the VTK libraries anyway in order to
calculate good offsets for them. The offset for the first VTK library is after
the last Mesa library so eventually we will have built all of VisIt's support
libraries so that they could be layed out in memory at their starting addresses
and never touch.

Since we added -prebind to the flags that are used when trying to link a shared
library, we can open each Makefile for the projects listed above and add the
above offsets after the -prebind flag. Before adding offsets though, you should
remove all of the shared libraries in the VTK/bin directory so make will cause
a relink of the libraries as we build them one by one.

rm bin/libvtk*
Example:
   1. cd Utilities/jpeg
   2. vi Makefile
   3. Search for -prebind
   4. After -prebind, add:
      -Wl,-seg1addr,0xB2C79000,
      -install_name,@executable_path/../lib/libvtkjpeg.dylib,
      -compatibility_version,4.2,-current_version,4.3
      
      Be sure to use the right library name in for the -install_name linker
      flag since that name is put into the library so the runtime linker can
      find the library relative to the executable's path. This helps make
      applications double-clickable.
      
   5. Save and exit vi
   6. make
   
Note: Be sure that you use a different offset for each library or prebinding
      will fail. The offsets for each VTK library are in the above table.
      Those offsets were computed by first building VTK and calculating the
      size of each library and then calculating an offset that arranges them
      safely one after another in a linear block of memory. There are small
      gaps between the libraries due to the algorithm that was used to lay
      them out in memory and because of segment alignment, which is
      currently 0x1000.

Building Python as a prebound dynamic library
===============================================================================

Python is a powerful, free scripting language that is used to drive VisIt's
viewer when running VisIt without a GUI. Python is cross platform and runs on
many UNIXes as well as MS Windows and other platforms. VisIt can be configured
to run without Python if scripting features are not desired.  Follow the
directions listed below to build Python.  If you have any problems building
or installing Python, read the README file in the Python distribution for more
information. I upgraded to Python-2.3.5 from Python-2.3.4 because of security
advisory: PSF-2005-001 - SimpleXMLRPCServer.py allows unrestricted traversal
and Python 2.4 with the security fix isn't ready yet.

tar -zxf Python-2.3.5.tgz
cd Python-2.3.5
# Before running configure.
# there is a bug in /usr/bin/sw_vers on MacOS X10.2 that shows up during
# configure. In configure change:
cur_target=`sw_vers -productVersion | sed 's/\(10\.[[0-9]]*\).*/\1/'`
to:
cur_target=`sw_vers | \
sed -n 's/ProductVersion:[[:blank:]]*[0-9]*.\([0-9]*\).[0-9]*/\1/p' | \
sed 's/\(10\.[0-9]*\).*/\1/'`

Building HDF5 as a prebound dynamic library
===============================================================================

HDF5 is a data storage library that allows you to efficiently write large
volumes of structured storage to a disk file. VisIt can technically be built
without support for HDF5 so it is an optional, but recommended, package. Though
it is optional, we build it before the Silo library because the Silo library
should be built with support for HDF5 when possible. If you don't want to build
HDF5, you can skip this section but you will have to take care that you do not
attempt to build Silo with support for HDF5.

tar -zxf hdf5-1.6.3.tar.gz
cd hdf5-1.6.3
./configure CFLAGS="-O2 -fPIC"
make

# The HDF5 libraries get built, even as dylib shared libraries. That's
# not quite good enough though since we want to set the beginning 
# address of the library and make it be prebound. We'll build our own
# version of the library using the prebuilt sources.

Building Silo as a prebound dynamic library
===============================================================================

Silo is a self-describing, machine-independent scientific file format.
Silo is one of the file formats supported by VisIt.  Follow the directions
listed below to build Silo.  If you have any problems building or installing
Silo, read the INSTALL_NOTES file in the SILO distribution for more
information.

Note that these instructions assume that Silo will be built with HDF5 support.
If you don't want to build Silo with HDF5 support, replace the --with-hdf5=...
with --without-hdf5. The library segment offsets used assume that Silo will be
built with support for HDF5. If you choose to disable HDF5 support, the
offsets will not be affected since the HDF5 version of the Silo library
should be larger.

Building Mili as a prebound dynamic library
===============================================================================

Mili is a database file format library for finite element codes. VisIt
has a database reader for this popular LLNL engineering database file
format. Mili file format support is optional and is not required for
VisIt to run.

tar -zxf mili.tar.gz
cd Mili
# configure was built with a real old version of autoconf, so it
# doesn't support the current GNU environment variable assignment syntax
CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-common -fPIC" ./configure ppc

===============================================================================
Building VisIt with prebinding
===============================================================================

Since we may want to add other libraries to our list of prebound
dynamic libraries, for database reader plugins, etc, we should 
reserve a memory range after the Python library. Suppose all other
libraries that we want can fit in 50Mb. If that assumption becomes invalid,
we can recalculate the offset for the VisIt libraries. The starting address
for the VisIt libraries using the current assumptions would then be:
0xB43F7000 + 50Mb

# Next offset
offset = 0xB442B000 + 0x2faf080 = B73DA080
# Align the offset to 0x1000 byte boundaries
offset = offset + (0x1000 - offset % 0x1000)
# Next offset
offset = 0xB73DB000

VisIt uses GNU's autoconf system to provide platform independence when
building VisIt in a UNIX environment. Autoconf creates a script called
configure that tests your system for various libraries and programs required
to build VisIt.  Follow the directions listed below to build VisIt.
More information about building VisIt follows after that.

#
# Configure VisIt

tar -zxf visit050307.tar.gz
cd visit050307/config-site
echo VISITHOME=$VISITPATH > `hostname`.conf
cat Template.conf >> `hostname`.conf
# Edit `hostname`.conf so that:
# DEFAULT_SILO_INCLUDES=$VISITHOME/silo/include

# HDF5 and Silo
#
If you built the Silo library with support for HDF5 using the instructions in
this document then you will need to modify VisIt's configure script somewhat so
programs that require the silo library also get linked with the HDF5 library.
On most other platforms, the Silo library is a static archive with the HDF5
symbols linked into it. These build instructions for MacOS X build Silo as a
dynamic, prebound library using a dynamic HDF5 library.

vi configure
replace -lsilo with: -lsilo -lhdf5
save and quit

vi configure
replace: echo "0x2322a000" > address.txt
with: echo "0xB73DB000" > address.txt
save and quit

./configure CXXFLAGS="-O2"

#
# If VisIt failed to configure properly, check the contents of the
# `hostname`.conf file to make sure that it points to the libraries that
# you build. You can look at whitestar.conf, which is a configuration file
# for another MacOS X computer, if you want an example file that works.
#

# Change the Silo optimization level.
The Silo database reader plugin fails to build on MacOS X with GCC3.3 because
it runs out of memory with the default -O2 optimization flag.

vi databases/Silo/Makefile
# Look for CXXFLAGS=$(CXXFLAGSORIG) and right after $(CXXFLAGSORIG), add -O1
# so the Silo database reader can build. The default optimization level (-O2)
# causes gcc to run out of memory on some MacOS X computers.

# edit viewer/main/ViewerSubject.C, comment out the lines:
# //  extern void qt_mac_set_no_native_menubar(bool);
# //  qt_mac_set_no_native_menubar(true);
