#   Added ZipWrapper plugin
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Aug 30 12:58:48 EDT 2007
#   The distclean should not reference the clean target here since
#   we're descending into subdirectories; this would mean the clean
#   target gets executed for all directories, then the distclean target
#   for all directories.  We just want the latter, so I copied the
#   non-subdir referencing stuff from the clean target to distclean.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep  6 16:50:53 EDT 2007
#   Having all thirdparty-dependent in ALLSUBDIRS is useless: we wind up
#   generating a Makefile for a directory that we know we will not be
#   able to build.  And, in fact, we cannot even generate dependencies for
#   it since we don't even have include files, and as such, even a make
#   distclean will fail.  Thus, I changed ALLSUBDIRS to ignore third-party-
#   dependent libraries we cannot build.
#   Also, use ALLSUBDIRS for distclean.
#
#   Brad Whitlock, Sat Sep 29 15:26:06 PST 2007

#   Added Cale reader.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Wed Oct 17 16:26:42 EDT 2007
#   Made the simulation plugins dependent on a variable determined during
#   configure, like the 3rd-party-dependent plugins.
#
#   Eric Brugger, Mon Jan  7 11:55:46 PST 2008
#   Added XDMF reader.
#
#   Hank Childs, Tue Jan  8 13:43:59 PST 2008

#   for different ITAPS implementations taking care not to remove something
#   someone may have been inadvertently editing or to remove the true
#   source in the ITAPS_C directory.
#
#   Brad Whitlock, Wed Oct 29 15:13:15 PDT 2008
#   Added Ralph Bruckschen's Gadget 2.0 reader.
