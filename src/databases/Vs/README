VizSchema Database Reader Plugin for VisIt

VizSchema is a specification for markup added to hdf5 files
to describe the data contained within.  Properly marked-up
files can be opened using this database reader, and thus
displayed in VisIt.  VizSchema also allows users to specify
run information and other miscellaneous data in a standardized
manner.  VizSchema is designed to be versatile and can be
added to data files after the fact.

VizSchema requires VisIt to be compiled with support for HDF5
