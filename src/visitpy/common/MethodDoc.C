"\n"

"\n"
"The ActivateDatabase function is used to set the active database to a\n"
"database that has been previously opened. The ActivateDatabase function\n"
"only works when you are using it to activate a database that you have\n"
"previously opened. You do not need to use this function unless you\n"
"frequently toggle between more than one database when making plots or\n"
"changing time states. While the OpenDatabase function can also be used\n"
"to set the active database, the ActivateDatabase function does not have any\n"
"side effects that would cause the time state for the new active database\n"
"to be changed.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"#% visit -cli\n"

"The AddArgument function is used to add extra command line arguments to\n"

"\n"
"VisIt allows the user to select subsets of databases. The description of\n"
"the subset is called a Subset Inclusion Lattice Restriction, or SIL\n"
"restriction. The SIL restriction allows databases to be subselected in\n"
"several different ways. The VisIt Python Interface provides the\n"
"SetPlotSILRestriction function to allow Python scripts to turn off portions\n"
"of the plotted database. The SetPlotSILRestriction function accepts a\n"
