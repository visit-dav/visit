"The ActivateDatabase function is used to set the active database to a\n"

"function. Assign the new plot attributes object into a variable and set its\n"

"The view is a crucial part of a visualization since it determines\n"

"provides four functions for setting the view: SetView2D, SetView3D,\n"
"SetViewCurve, and SetViewAxisArray. If the visualization window\n"
"contains 2D plots, use the SetView2D function. Use the SetView3D\n"
"function when the visualization window contains 3D plots.  Similarly\n"
"for windows containing curve or axis-array based plots.  To set the\n"
"view, first create the appropriate ViewAttributes object and set the\n"
"object's fields to set a new view. After setting the fields, pass the\n"
"object to the matching SetView function. A common use of the SetView\n"
"functions is to animate the view to produce simple animations where\n"
"the camera appears to fly around the plots in the visualization\n"
"window.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"A View3D object also supports the RotateAxis(int axis, double deg)\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Description:\n"
"\n"
"The Turn functions are provided to simplify the removal of material or\n"
"domain subsets. Instead of creating a SILRestriction object, you can use\n"
"the Turn functions to turn materials or domains on or off. The\n"
"TurnMaterialsOn function turns materials on and the TurnMaterialsOff\n"
"function turns them off. The TurnDomainsOn function turns domains on and\n"
"the TurnDomainsOff function turns them off. All of the Turn functions have\n"
"three possible argument lists. When you do not provide any arguments, the\n"
"function applies to all subsets in the SIL so if you called the\n"
"TurnMaterialsOff function with no arguments, all materials would be turned\n"
"off. Calling TurnMaterialsOn with no arguments would turn all materials on.\n"
"All functions can also take a string argument, which is the name of the set\n"
"to modify. For example, you could turn off domain 0 by calling the\n"
"TurnDomainsOff with a single argument of \"domain0\" (or the appropriate\n"
"set name). All of the Turn functions can also be used to modify more than\n"
"one set if you provide a tuple of set names. After you use the Turn\n"
"functions to change the SIL restriction, you might want to call the\n"
"ListMaterials or ListDomains functions to make sure that the SIL\n"
"restriction was actually modified.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Description:\n"
"This function causes VisIt to reevaluate a named selection using new selection\n"
