"\n"
"    ActivateDatabase returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Description:\n"
"\n"
"The ActivateDatabase function is used to set the active database to a\n"
"database that has been previously opened. The ActivateDatabase\n"
"function only works when you are using it to activate a database that\n"
"you have previously opened. You do not need to use this function\n"
"unless you frequently toggle between more than one database when\n"
"making plots or changing time states. While the OpenDatabase function\n"
"can also be used to set the active database, the ActivateDatabase\n"
"function does not have any side effects that would cause the time\n"
"state for the new active database to be changed.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"#% visit -cli\n"

"argument : string\n"
"    A string object that is added to the viewer's command line argument list.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Description:\n"
"\n"
"The AddArgument function is used to add extra command line arguments\n"
"to VisIt's viewer. This is only useful when VisIt's Python interface\n"
"is imported into a stand-alone Python interpreter because the\n"
"AddArgument function must be called before the viewer is launched. The\n"
"AddArgument function has no effect when used in VisIt's cli program\n"
"because the viewer is automatically launched before any commands are\n"

"\n"
"operator : string\n"

"    This is an optional integer argument that applies the operator to all\n"

"\n"
"Description:\n"
"\n"
"The AddOperator function adds a VisIt operator to the active plots.\n"
"The operator argument is a string containing the name of the operator\n"
"to be added to the active plots. The operatore name must be a valid\n"
"operator plugin name that is a member of the tuple returned by the\n"
"OperatorPlugins function. The all argument is an integer that\n"
"determines whether or not the operator is applied to all plots. If the\n"
"all argument is not provided, the operator is only added to active\n"
"plots. Once the AddOperator function is called, the desired operator\n"

"\n"
"The OpenComputeEngine function is used to explicitly open a compute\n"
"engine with certain properties. When a compute engine is opened\n"
"implicitly, the viewer relies on sets of attributes called host\n"
"profiles. Host profiles determine how compute engines are launched.\n"
"This allows compute engines to be easily launched in parallel. Since\n"
"the VisIt Python Interface does not expose VisIt's host profiles, it\n"
"provides the OpenComputeEngine function to allow users to launch\n"
"compute engines. The OpenComputeEngine function must be called before\n"
"opening a database in order to prevent any latent host profiles from\n"
"taking precedence.\n"

"\n"
