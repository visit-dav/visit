# Purpose:
#     Creates a dummy movie.  The purpose of this script is to demonstrate
#     some of the scripting capabilities of VisIt.

#   Previously referring to different versions of wave.visit.  Now only refer
#   to one.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Aug 29 16:29:36 PDT 2003
#    I modified the script to use the new interface for setting views.

# Tell VisIt what files you want to look at.
#
# In the GUI, VisIt will automatically recognize file naming conventions and
# make "virtual databases" out of them.  In the CLI, this functionality does
# not exist.  However, you can tell VisIt which files you are interested in
# using a ".visit file".  This is just a text file that has all of the files
# you want to look at.
