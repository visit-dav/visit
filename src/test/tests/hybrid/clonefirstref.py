# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  CLASSES: nightly
#
#  Test Case:  clonefirstref.py
#
#  Tests:      mesh      - 2D, curvilinear, single domain
#              plots     - FilledBoundary
#              databases - PDB
#
#  Purpose:    This test case tests the viewer's ability to consider a window
#              that had been referenced as unreferenced if its plot list has
#              no active source.
