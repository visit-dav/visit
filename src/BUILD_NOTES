                         ==============================

VisIt relies on several external libraries which must be built and installed
prior to building VisIt.  This document provides detailed step by step
instructions for building VisIt and each of the dependent libraries.  The
instructions have been designed so that you can cut and paste most of the
commands needed to build the libraries and VisIt from this file into your
shell prompt.


    Library  Version  Description            For More information

The public version of VisIt has been built with the above listed versions
of the libraries, so it is known to work properly with those versions.  For
all the packages except VTK and Qt, you can probably use newer versions of the
packages and VisIt should work properly.  For Mesa, you must build a mangled
version of Mesa.  The distribution provided has already been set up to build
a mangled version so no additional work is required if you use it.  For VTK,
you must use the October 28, 2003 distribution provided. The version of Qt used to
build VisIt must be greater than or equal to 2.3.0. VisIt is also compatible
with Qt version 3.

Building VisIt
===============

VisIt can currently be built on aix, irix, linux, solaris, tru64 and
windows operating systems.  The following instructions only apply to
building VisIt on Unix systems and does not apply to Windows.

We currently build VisIt using the following compilers on the following
operating systems.  It is suggested that you use the same compilers.


   Operating System          Compiler
   ================          ========
   AIX 5.1                   g++ 3.1
   MacOS X 10.3 (Darwin)     g++ 3.3
   IRIX64 6.5                MIPSpro 7.3.1.1m and MIPSpro 7.3.1.2m
   Redhat Linux 7.1 and 7.2  g++ 2.96
   Solaris 7                 g++ 2.95.2
   Tru64 5.1                 g++ 3.0.4 

The following compilers will *NOT* work with VisIt.  They will either not
compile VisIt or will generate bad code.

   Operating System          Compiler
   ================          ========
   IRIX64 6.5                MIPSpro 7.4

It is essential that you build all the dependent packages and VisIt using
the same c++ compiler or you will encounter linking problems because different
compilers or different versions of the same compiler may use different name
mangling schemes.

If you are using gmake or are building on an SGI and your machine has
multiple CPUs, you may speed up the build process for many of the products
by doing a parallel make.  For gmake, the command would be

   make -j "# of processors"

and for an SGI the command would be

   env PARALLEL="# of processors" make -P

Lets go ahead and build VisIt.  Start off by creating a directory to hold
VisIt and the installed versions of each of the dependent libraries.

mkdir visit
echo `pwd`/visit > visitpath

Now build each of the dependent libraries followed by VisIt.


Mesa
=====

Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of
OpenGL.  It is used for performing off-screen rendering.

#
# Build Mesa
#
gunzip Mesa-5.0-mangled.tar.gz
tar xf Mesa-5.0-mangled.tar
cd Mesa-5.0

#
# To build Mesa, one of the following targets should probably be used.  The
# complete list of targets is available by typing "make" in the Mesa-5.0
# directory.
#
#  make aix                  for IBM RS/6000
#  make darwin               for Macintosh systems running MacOS X
#  make irix6-n32-dso        for SGI systems with IRIX 6.x, make n32-bit DSOs
#  make irix6-64-dso         for SGI systems with IRIX 6.x, make 64-bit DSOs
#  make linux                for Linux systems, make shared .so libs
#  make linux-alpha          for Linux on Alpha systems
#  make osf1-sl              for DEC Alpha systems with OSF/1, make shared libs
#  make solaris-x86          for PCs with Solaris
#  make solaris-x86-gcc      for PCs with Solaris using GCC
#  make sunos5-sl            for Suns with SunOS 5.x, make shared libs
#  make sunos5-gcc-sl        for Suns with SunOS 5.x, GCC, make shared libs

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the mesa directory.
#
mkdir ../visit/mesa
mkdir ../visit/mesa/{include,lib}
mkdir ../visit/mesa/include/GL
cp include/GL/*.h ../visit/mesa/include/GL
#
# On AIX systems you will need to build shared libraries from the
# archives.
#
# cd lib
# ar -x libMesaGL.a
# g++ -Wl,-G -shared -o libMesaGL.so -Wl,-bmaxdata:0x70000000 -Wl,-brtl *.o
# rm *.o
# ar -x libOSMesa.a
# g++ -Wl,-G -shared -o libOSMesa.so -Wl,-bmaxdata:0x70000000 -Wl,-brtl *.o
# rm *.o
# cd ..
#

cp lib/*.so       ../visit/mesa/lib 
cd ..

VTK
====

VTK is an object oriented library for visualizing 3D data.  VisIt uses it
for all its visualization functionality. Follow the directions listed below
to build VTK.  If you have any problems building or installing VTK, read the
VTK/README.html file included in the VTK distribution for more information.

#
# Build CMake which is used by VTK to configure its distribution
#
gunzip cmake-1.8.1.tar.gz
tar xf cmake-1.8.1.tar
cd cmake-1.8.1
#
# We have experienced problems building CMake on AIX with g++/gcc.
# so for AIX use the native compilers to build CMake: 
# env CXX=xlC CC=xlc CXXFLAGS="" ./bootstrap
# otherwise:
env CXXFLAGS="" ./bootstrap
make

#
# Build VTK
#
cd ..
gunzip vtk_cvs_2003_10_28.tar.gz
tar xf vtk_cvs_2003_10_28.tar
cd VTK
../cmake-1.8.1/bin/cmake .
#
# Edit CMakeCache.txt.  Turn BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, VTK_USE_HYBRID, and
# VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA on, Turn BUILD_TESTING off.
#
# If you want to change the compilers you should modify CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
# and CMAKE_C_COMPILER.  If you want to change the compiler flags you should
# modify CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_FLAGS.  You might want to specify "-O2"
# as a compiler flag to build an optimized version.  If you want to specify
# the location of the OpenGL library you should modify OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY
# (/usr/shlib/libGL.so on tru64 systems.)
#
# On AIX, you may experience problems with X11 headers. Check the following
# and modify as necessary: CMAKE_X_FLAGS, X11_X11_INCLUDE_PATH, 
# X11_Xlib_INCLUDE_PATH, X11_Xutil_INCLUDE_PATH
#
../cmake-1.8.1/bin/cmake .
#
# Edit CMakeCache.txt, setting MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR, MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY,
# MANGLED_OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR, MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY, to point to the appropriate 
# files and directories in the mesa directory.
# For example:
#
# MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/home/visit/mesa/include
# MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/home/visit/mesa/lib/libMesaGL.so
# MANGLED_OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/home/visit/mesa/include
# MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/home/visit/mesa/lib/libOSMesa.so
#
# Note that you need to be very careful in setting the above variables so
# that you provide the appropriate filename or path.
#
../cmake-1.8.1/bin/cmake .

#
# On linux systems you will want to avoid using runtime type identification
# (rtti) to achieve maximum portability among different versions of linux.
# Ideally this would be done by editing CMakeCache.txt, adding "-fno-rtti"
# to the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS string and running cmake, but alas, this doesn't
# work.  The work around is to do the following:
#    env CXXFLAGS="-fno-rtti" ../cmake-1.8.1/bin/cmake
#
# This indirectly turns off rtti, because VTK_NO_ANSI_STRING_STREAM is set
# to 1.  This causes vtkOStrStreamWrapper.cxx to use <strstream> instead
# of <sstream>, which requires rtti.
#

#
# On tru64 systems using g++ 3.0.4, several files in the Imaging directory
# will not compile because of an internal compiler error.  You will need to
# comment out the code in the method ThreadedExecute (with "#if 0" as the
# first line in the method and "#endif" as the last line in the method.)
# The files are:
#    Imaging/vtkImageContinuousDilate3D.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageContinuousErode3D.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageConvolve.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageRange3D.cxx
#    Imaging/vtkImageVariance3D.cxx
#
make

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the vtk directory.
#

#
# Several of the header files in MangleMesaInclude have absolute paths
# of other headers files that are located in the directories you built
# VTK in.  This means that even though the header files were copied to
# the visit/vtk directory, there are still references to header files
# in directories where you built VTK.  This may cause problems if you
# later remove the directories where you built VTK, or if someone else
# were to use your installation and the permissions in your directories
# were incorrect.
#

Qt
===

The Qt toolkit from Trolltech is a free (for non-commercial use), cross-
platform Graphical User Inteface toolkit that runs on X11, MS Windows, and
Mac-X. VisIt uses Qt as the basis of its GUI and Viewer.  Follow the
directions listed below to build Qt.  You can use Qt version 2.3.0 or 3.0.2
on all the systems except tru64 where you must use 3.0.2.  Version 2.3.0
generally looks nicer than version 3.0.2, so we recommend it where possible.
If you have any problems building or installing Qt, read the INSTALL file
in the Qt distribution for more information.

#
# Build Qt 2.3.0
#
gunzip qt-x11-2.3.0.tar.gz
tar xf qt-x11-2.3.0.tar
cd qt-2.3.0

Silo
=====

Silo is a self-describing, machine-independent scientific file format.
Silo is one of the file formats supported by VisIt.  Follow the directions
listed below to build Silo.  If you have any problems building or installing
Silo, read the INSTALL_NOTES file in the SILO distribution for more
information.

Note: for Itanium (ia64) systems, the -fpic flag is needed.  You can replace
CFLAGS=-O2 with CFLAGS="-fpic -O2" in the configure command below.

#
# Build Silo
#
sh silo040308.sh
cd silo040308
env CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure --without-readline --without-hdf5 --without-exodus
make

#
# Install it in the visit directory under the silo directory.
#
mkdir ../visit/silo
mkdir ../visit/silo/include
mkdir ../visit/silo/lib
cp silo/silo/silo.h   ../visit/silo/include
cp silo/silo/silo.inc ../visit/silo/include
cp silo/sdx/sdx.h     ../visit/silo/include
cp silo/sdx/sdx.inc   ../visit/silo/include
cp lib/libsilo.a      ../visit/silo/lib
cd ..


Python
=======

Python is a powerful, free scripting language that is used to drive VisIt's
viewer when running VisIt without a GUI. Python is cross platform and runs on
many UNIXes as well as MS Windows and other platforms. VisIt can be configured
to run without Python if scripting features are not desired.  Follow the
directions listed below to build Python.  If you have any problems building
or installing Python, read the README file in the Python distribution for more
information.

Note: for Itanium (ia64) systems, the -fpic flag is needed.  To add this flag
to python's build, do the following:  (1) Follow the commands below until the
configure step.  Execute configure as given.  (2) Look at the Makefile and find
the value of the variable OPT.  (3) Re-execute configure with OPT specified
through the env command, with -fpic added to OPT.  For example:
    env OPT="-fpic -O2" ./configure --prefix=`cat ../visitpath`/python
where the "-O2" was the value of OPT in the makefile.  (4) Continue with
the commands below as given.

#
# Build and install it in the visit directory under the python directory.
#
gunzip Python-2.1.2.tar.gz
tar xf Python-2.1.2.tar
cd Python-2.1.2
./configure --prefix=`cat ../visitpath`/python
make
make install

#
# You will also need to create a shared version of the python library.
#
mkdir tmpdir
cd tmpdir
ar -x ../libpython2.1.a
# Use the appropriate command based on the operating system on which
# you are creating the shared library.
g++ -Wl,-G -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                         # aix
g++ -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                                # irix
g++ -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                                # linux
g++ -Wl,-G -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o                                 # solaris
g++ -Wl,-expect_unresolved -Wl,'*' -shared -o ../libpython2.1.so *.o # tru64
cd ..
rm -rf tmpdir
cp libpython2.1.so ../visit/python/lib/python2.1/config/libpython2.1.so
cd ..


VisIt
======

VisIt uses GNU's autoconf system to provide platform independence when
building VisIt in a UNIX environment. Autoconf creates a script called
configure that tests your system for various libraries and programs required
to build VisIt.  Follow the directions listed below to build VisIt.
More information about building VisIt follows after that.

Note: for Itanium (ia64) systems, add the -fpic flag to the CXXFLAGS in the
env command for configure.

#
# Build and install it in the visit directory.
#
gunzip visit040517.tar.gz
tar xf visit040517.tar
cd visit040517/config-site
echo VISITHOME=`cat ../../visitpath` > `hostname`.conf
cat Template.conf >> `hostname`.conf
cd ..
env CXXFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
make
clearcase_bin/visit-bin-dist
# Use the appropriate install command based on the operating system on
# which you built VisIt.
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.3.1 aix `cat ../visitpath`
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.3.1 irix6 `cat ../visitpath`
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.3.1 linux `cat ../visitpath`
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.3.1 osf1 `cat ../visitpath`
clearcase_bin/visit-install 1.3.1 sunos5 `cat ../visitpath`

When running the configure script you can enable or disable certain dependent
packages.  All the configure options are listed at the beginning of the
configure script or can listed by the configure script by typing
"./configure -help".  The most commonly used options are:

  --enable-parallel       make the parallel version
  --disable-scripting     build without Python scripting capability
  --enable-java           build the Java interface library
  --enable-buildall       build all plugins

  --with-hdf5=INC,LIB     Location of HDF5 header and library
  --with-vbt=INC,LIB      Location of VBT/DSL headers and libraries
  --with-saf=INC,LIB      Location of SAF headers and libraries

  --with-exodus[=<DIR>]           enable Exodus driver
  --with-exodus-include[=<DIR>]   specify Exodus include path
  --with-exodus-lib[=<DIR>]       specify Exodus lib path

The enable parallel option builds the parallel version of VisIt.  Parallel
versions are supported on SGI and IBM AIX systems.  The disable scripting
option builds VisIt without the Python scripting.  The enable buildall
option builds all the VisIt plugins.  By default, only the most common
plugins are built.

The second group of options are used when building with support for reading
SAF files.  The third group of options are used when building with support
for reading exodus files.

If you have any problems send e-mail to visit-help@llnl.gov.
