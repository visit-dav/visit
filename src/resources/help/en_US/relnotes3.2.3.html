<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.2.3</font></b></p>

  <li>Fixed a bug with expression insert-function for constant expressions, so usage is clearer. </li>
  <li>Ensure variable names from PlainText reader have no leading or trailing whitespace.</li>
  <li>Fixed a time slider widget window resize bug so that now the main gui window width is not locked and can be shrunk and expanded.</li>
  <li>VisIt can now build successfully with ADIOS enabled while MPI is disabled.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the list of plugins in the file open window could disappear when selecting plugins from the list multiple times.</li>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 3.2.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated the Ohio Supercomputing Center host profiles.</li>
  <li>Chombo plugin now supports anisotropic refinements.</li>
  <li>The WData database reader was added.</li>
  <li>Moved the <i>divergence</i>, <i>curl</i>, <i>Laplacian</i>, and <i>gradient</i> functions from the <i>Miscellaneous</i> submenu to the <i>Vector</i> submenu within the <i>Insert function...</i> menu in the Expressions window. </li>
  <li>Added implicit points topology support to the Blueprint Plugin.</li>
  <li>Added polyhedral mesh support to the Blueprint Plugin. Now, if you ask visit to read a polyhedral mesh, it will automatically convert the mesh to a tetrahedral mesh, as well as convert the fields as needed. It will also keep track of original element ids so that you don't see the new lines from the resulting tetrahedra.</li>
  <li>In the file open window, next to "Open file as type:" when you click "Guess from file name/extension", the list of file types is now sorted in alphabetical case-insensitive order. The same change has been made in the list of Databases in the Plugin Manager.</li>
  <li>VisIt-generated expressions are no longer included in VTK, Blueprint, and Silo exports.</li>
  <li>In the plugin selection in the file open window, users can now delete the text that is there and start typing the name of the plugin that they wish to open files with, and VisIt will autocomplete the entered text to select a plugin.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.2.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>--dry-run</i> command line option has been removed.</li>
  <li>Added the spack environment files <i>compilers.yaml</i> and <i>packages.yaml</i> for crusher.olcf.ornl.gov.</li>
