<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.1.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed xml tools failure when full version specified (eg xml2cmake -v 3.1.2).</li>
  <li>Fixed Printing to printer and Printing to PDF on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the pick operator would choose ghost zones while picking from mili datasets.</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs with the Blueprint plugin for cases where domain data also exists in the root file.</li>
  <li>Fixed ability to save a movie template via the Save Movie Wizard on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs with the avtLinesFileFormat reader. The reader can now distinguish 2D from 3D, and it will not remove identical consecutive points that exist on different lines.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash with the generation of ghost zones using global node ids where there were NULL domains.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused trilinear ray casting to have very harsh lighting.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug importing remote hosts.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug preventing full removal of the axes when using OSPRay rendering.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that was preventing VisIt from correctly generating normals for triangle strips.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug reading files generated with newer Exodus libraries.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where 2D axes annotation font settings weren't always saved to config files.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where lines starting with !TIME and !ENSEMBLE ".visit" files weren't being processed properly and were interpreted as file names.</li>
  <li>Reduced amount of '.' written to log files while waiting for processes to connect.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 3.1.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed the pbatch launch profile from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Max host profile.</li>
  <li>Added host profiles for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Magma system.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the CGNS plugin to support a mesh decomposed across multiple CGNS files, one block per file as might be typical of file-per-processor parallel I/O. This requires that each file contain just a single CGNS mesh block. In addition, if all files do not also contain the same number of time steps, results will be indeterminate. The collection of CGNS files can be grouped together into a .visit file or follow the naming convention "basename.cgns.nblocks.iblock", where basename is any string, cgns is the string "cgns", nblocks is the number of blocks, and iblock is the block index.</li>
  <li>Enhanced VTK plugin to support reading and writing VisIt expressions as non-specific FIELD variable named "VisItExpressions" of type string. To see an example, look at the example file named <code>higher_order_triangles.vtk</code> in <a href="https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/blob/develop/data/vtk_test_data.7z?raw=true">vtk_test_data.7z</a></li>
  <li>Enhanced the Pick Through Time to use a substantially faster algorithm by default. This algorithm will be enabled when preserving the picked element id. When preserving the picked coordinate, the original algorithm will be used instead.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the new default Pick Through Time algorithm to handle vectors, tensors, and arrays. For vectors, the magnitude is used. For tensors and arrays, the major eigenvalue is used.</li>
  <li>Expressions in the GUI Expression window will now appear alphabetically sorted.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.1.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The build_visit script was enhanced to allow VisIt to build on Ubuntu 19.10 systems using gcc 9.2.</li>
</ul>
