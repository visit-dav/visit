<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.4.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Wavefront OBJ Writer that would result in incorrect coloring for minimum or maximum values in downstream tools such as PowerPoint.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with Pick unable to return results for 2D datasets.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where vtk error messages were printed to the terminal when adding an Image Annotation Object to the viewer window.</li>
  <li>Changed default logic for guessing cycles from file names to not consider any digits in the file name extension if present. This fixed the guessing logic for cases where a file extension includes a digit (e.g. <code>.h5m</code>)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where glyphed line endpoints could be colored incorrectly in the Pseudocolor plot.</li>
  <li>Fixed a VTK Texture Buffer error that caused error messages to be printed to the command line.</li>
  <li>Fixed a Mesh plot bug where transparency would not be honored.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 3.4.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added the ability to invert the color table for the Wavefront OBJ writer.</li>
  <li>Upgraded MFEM library version to 4.6.0.</li>
  <li>The <i>surface_normal</i> expression now accepts mesh types other than polydata, allowing it to be used more easily as an operator-created variable.</li>
  <li>Added more keywords ("MFA", "2fa", "Autentication", and "OTP") that cause VisIt clients to open a second popup for a password.</li>
  <li>GetPlotInformation() can now contain entries for multiple-curves when Query-over-time is performed on multiple variables. For example, if a pick-through-time was performed for variables 'u' and 'v', the curve for 'v' would be retrieved via 'GetPlotInformation()['Curves']['v']. Single variable results will still be retrieved via 'GetPlotInformation()['Curve'].</li>
  <li>Updated the ADIOS2 library version to 2.10.0-rc1, allowing BP5 files to be read by VisIt.</li>
  <li>Removed the dependency on C-Blosc1.</li>
  <li>Added a new dependency on C-Blosc2.</li>
</ul>
