<a name="General_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The behavior of Python's <code>help</code> was modified to first present what <code>help</code> would normally produce followed by the output from <code>apropos</code> when that output is non-empty.</li>
  <li>The French translation was updated thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cessenat">@cessenat</a>. We are still looking for volunteers for translations in other languages. If interested, please <a href="https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/support/">contact us</a>.</li>
  <li>A new (beta) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_given_to_the_Spanish_language">Castilian Spanish</a> translation was created thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cessenat">@cessenat</a> using auto-translation from English. It likely still requires review by someone who is fluent in Spanish and we would welcome any volunteers.</li>
  <li>References to old email lists (@ornl.gov) throughout code and documentation were replaced with references to the help pages of the new website.</li>
  <li>The <code>Pick</code> operator now has the option to include the Euclidean distance between the current and previous <code>Pick</code> in the GUI's output window. To enable this option, check the <code>Distance to previous</code> box. You should then see a new field in the tabular output display titled <code>Distance to previous</code>.</li>
  <li>Support for <i>SeedMe</i> was removed since the service was retired.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint export now supports repartitioning the mesh on output. In the Blueprint export options, select the "Partition" operation and set the target number of domains field.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint export now supports flattening the mesh data on output. In the Blueprint export options, select "Flatten_CSV" to export the mesh data to vertex and element based CSV files, or "Flatten_HDF5" to export the data to a Blueprint "Table" node.</li>
  <li>The Flatten() function has been added to the Python scripting interface; this function uses the new avtFlattenQuery to return the active plot data as a tabular, numpy compatible, 2D array.</li>
  <li>Changed "active" to "default" for everything related to color tables. This includes the GUI, in the Python scripting interface, and internally.</li>
  <li>Added support and examples of 2D structured grids representing surfaces in 3 dimensions.</li>
  <li>Many new, color vision deficient (CVD) color tables from <a href="https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/visualisation/">Fabio Crameri</a> were added and assigned the tags <code>CvdFriendly</code> and <code>Crameri</code>.</li>
  <li>Existing Viridis CVD color tables were given new tag names, <code>CvdFriendly</code> and <code>Viridis</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Text annotation macros (e.g. $time, $cycle, ...) have been enhanced in some key ways. First, more macros are available including $index, $dbcomment, $numstates, etc.. Next, printf-style formatting can be specified for a macro and multiple instances of the same or different macros can appear in the same annotation object.</li>
  <li>Attribute assignment (e.g. <code>cylinderAtts.point1=...</code> or <code>cylinderAtts.SetPoint1(...)</code>) operations in the Python scripting interface were modified to catch and disallow incorrect usage instead of silently falling back to default values. Better error checks and messages were also added. It is possible these changes may cause code that worked fine to now terminate with a Python exception. In such cases, the resulting error message should explain the cause of the failure and the changes required to fix it should be obvious and minimal.</li>
  <li>A new function was added to the Python scripting interface named <code>apropos(regex)</code> similar in purpose to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apropos_(Unix)">Unix' apropos</a>. It makes finding the names of functions and objects much easier. It will return a list of the names of functions or objects where the regular expression matches either in the method name or in the documentation string for the method or in a stringified instance (objects only). All matching is case insensitive.</li>
  <li>ColorControlPointsList and GaussianControlPointsList now have a 'SetNum' method for changing the size of the underlying controlPoints list. Control points will be added or removed based on the current size of the list. The SetNum method was also added to the script created by Logging / command recording, so that the control points list has the correct size and the created script can execute correctly without crashing the cli.</li>
  <li>A section was added to the <i>Developer Manual</i> describing process launching.</li>
  <li>A section was added to the <i>Developer Manual</i> describing building VisIt with spack.</li>
  <li>A tutorial on Python expressions was added to the tutorials section of the manual.</li>
</ul>

<a name="GUI_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes in GUI behavior for version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the file open window, next to "Open file as type:" when you click "Guess from file name/extension", the list of file types is now sorted in alphabetical case-insensitive order. The same change has been made in the list of Databases in the Plugin Manager.</li>
  <li>In the plugin selection in the file open window, users can now delete the text that is there and start typing the name of the plugin that they wish to open files with, and VisIt will autocomplete the entered text to select a plugin.</li>
  <li>Custom titles for Legend annotation objects can now be set.</li> 
  <li>Dolly and FlyThrough navigation modes now support mouse-wheel interaction for zooming.</li>
  <li>Changing navigation mode (Trackball, Dolly, FlyThrough) will now trigger an automatic View reset.</li>
  <li>The Color Table Window and Buttons have been redesigned, with the color table categories replaced with a new tagging system. Color tables have a number of tags associated with them, and when tag filtering is enabled, users can select multiple tags to see only color tables associated with those tags. There are additional options for how tag selection affects the resulting matching list of ColorTables.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The informational message displayed after successfully exporting a database now contains the host and path to the file.</li>
  <li>The Chombo reader now supports anisotropic refinements.</li>
  <li>The WData reader was added.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint reader was enhanced to support the implicit points topology.</li>
  <li>Added the ability for users to specify the output precision when exporting Xmdv (.okc) files.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint reader was enhanced to support polyhedral meshes. If you read a polyhedral mesh, it will automatically convert the mesh to a tetrahedral mesh, as well as convert the fields as needed. It will also keep track of original element ids so that you don't see the new lines from the resulting tetrahedra.</li>
  <li>The Xolotl reader was updated to support phase-space.</li>
  <li>The SW4 reader was renamed as sw4img to fix static builds.</li>
  <li>The NASTRAN reader was modified to reduce the amount of debug outputs and handle DOS line endings.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint reader now supports the option to choose between two different MFEM low order refinement schemes. The Legacy option is the original LOR scheme used by VisIt, and the new option preserves the continuity of meshes. The new option is enabled by default.</li>
  <li>VisIt-generated expressions are no longer included in VTK, Blueprint, and Silo exports.</li>
  <li>The ADIOS and ADIOS2 readers were updated to build with c-blosc, so blosc-compressed ADIOS-based files can now be read by VisIt.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pseudocolor Plot Limits now say "Use Actual Data" instead of "Use Current Plot".</li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added the <i>logical_nodeid</i>, <i>logical_zoneid</i>, <i>node_domain</i>, <i>zone_domain</i>, and <i>zone_centers</i> mesh expressions.</li>
  <li>Moved the <i>divergence</i>, <i>curl</i>, <i>Laplacian</i>, and <i>gradient</i> functions from the <i>Miscellaneous</i> submenu to the <i>Vector</i> submenu within the <i>Insert function...</i> menu in the Expressions window. </li>
  <li>Added the new <i>ghost_zoneid</i> function to the <i>Mesh</i> submenu in the Expressions window.</li>
  <li>Added the new <i>crack_width</i> function to the <i>Misc</i> submenu in the Expressions window.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded the X Ray Image Query so it can now output conduit Blueprint files.</li>
  <li>Upgraded the X Ray Image Query so users can now specify an output directory for query results.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug with expression insert-function for constant expressions, so that the usage is clearer. </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the PlainText reader, where leading and trailing whitespace was included int the variable names.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the time slider in the main window would resize so that the window width was extremely wide in some situations.</li>
  <li>VisIt now builds successfully with ADIOS enabled while MPI is disabled.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the list of plugins in the file open window could disappear when selecting plugins from the list multiple times.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where changing the 'Number format' for a Contour plot's legend would have no affect on the labels next to the tick marks.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that prevented users from comparing particular VisIt Python objects in the Python scripting interface with non-VisIt types.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash with libsim when attempting to Export databases that have export options specified as enums.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Right-Clicking in the Viewer Window to access popup menu was preventing mouse-wheel navigation functionality until another mouse click was performed.</li>
  <li>Fixed several bugs with 'Flythrough' navigation mode: multiple calls to ResetView would make the plot disappear; adding new plots would make them disappear from view; issuing a 'Recenter View' would move the camera inside the plot.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the bounding box extents would not be reset when 'Scale 3D Axes' was turned off.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash in the Python scripting interface when 'DeleteAllPlots' is called when there are no plots and a callback has been registered for 'SetActivePlots'.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in visit_composite where output formats like bmp, png could not be read back in by VisIt nor used to encode movies.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the Python scripting where the PySide2 module wouldn't load when running one of the pre-built binaries.</li>
  <li>The Contour plot's fields were re-ordered internally to fix a bug where a command-recorded script of a Contour plot would crash the Python scripting interface if the number of contours had been increased from the default.</li>
  <li>The images and wording for Curve Overlay and Reflected Curve Overlay templates in the Save Movie Wizard were updated to demonstrate that they can be used on 3D plots, not just 2D plots.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the color table window where the list of color tables could be populated even when no tags were selected.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Configuration_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added host profiles for machines located at KAUST.</li>
  <li>Updated the Ohio Supercomputing Center host profiles.</li>
  <li>Updated the ORNL host file list to include only current machines.</li>
  <li>Renamed the <i>mxterm</i> launch profiles to <i>sxterm</i> in the LLNL host profiles since <i>mxterm</i> has been replaced with <i>sxterm</i>."
  <li>Updated the <i>toss3</i> installations at LLNL so that they would also run on <i>toss4</i> systems.</li>
  <li>Updated the LLNL host profiles for <i>toss</i> systems to use <i>sbatch</i> instead of <i>msub</i> when launching batch jobs.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Build_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Build features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Build_visit was modified to do an out-of-source build for Qt.</li>
  <li>Enhanced build_visit to optionally build Qt 5.10.1 instead of Qt 5.14.2. To enable building Qt 5.10.1, add <i>--qt510</i> to the command line.</li>
  <li>Build_visit was enhanced to patch Xdmf so that it builds with gcc 11.2.</li>
  <li>The <i>--dry-run</i> command line option was removed from build_visit.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>VTK-m was updated to version 1.7.0 and VTK-h was updated to version 0.8.0.</li>
  <li>Added the spack environment files <i>compilers.yaml</i> and <i>packages.yaml</i> for crusher.olcf.ornl.gov.</li>
  <li>There is now a WIN32DEFINES xml tag for database plugins, used to specify preprocessor defines needed by a plugin on Windows. If the needed define comes from a thirdparty library, the Find module for that library should set a CMake var with those defines that the plugin could then use in the .xml file. See FindCGNS.cmake and CGNS.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The minimum required version of CMake is now 3.14, the version built by build_visit.</li> 
  <li>The programs qtviswinExample, qtvtkExample, qvtkopenglExample were added to help with debugging OpenGL issues.</li>
  <li>VisIt test data archive tooling was changed from 7z to tar with the same (lzma2) compression.</li>
  <li>The version of Conduit was upgraded to 0.8.2.</li>
  <li>VisIt now calculates the topological dimension of the data tree after the data was retrieved from the database, and after SIL and/or Material selection was applied. This should aid downstream filters that depend on an accurate topological dimension. For mixed-topology datasets the largest topological dimension is what gets reported. Filters that modify topological structure are still required to update the topological dimension.</li>
  <li>The DEFINES, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS tags in the xml files for plugins now support an optional "components" attribute specifying for which component(s) the tag applies. Currently valid for MDServer("M"), serial Engine ("ESer") and parallel Engine("EPar"). Multiple components may be specified, separated by commas. See ADIOS2.xml or MOAB.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The DEFINES tag now supports surrounding definitions in quotes if the quotes are important to be carried through. They must be escaped with a '\'. See uintah.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The version of MFEM was upgraded to 4.4.</li>
  <li>Added the script <i>run-build-visit</i> for running <i>build_visit</i> to build the third party libraries on LLNL systems. The script has the following usage:<br>
    <pre>
    Usage: +"machine name" -v "version" -s "build_visit_script"
    Valid machine names:
        kickit_mesagl (B-Div, Linux, x86_64, mesagl),
        kickit_opengl (B-Div, Linux, x86_64, opengl),
        quartz (LC, Linux, x86_64),
        lassen (LC, Linux, power9),
        rztrona (LC, Linux, x86_64),
        rzansel (LC, Linux, power9),
        jade (LC, Linux, x86_64),
        sierra (LC, Linux, power9)</pre></li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the regression test suite where the image difference metrics were reported incorrectly in the HTML and JSON output.</li>
  <li>Added <code>TestAutoName()</code> method for automagically naming test baseline files.</li>
  <li>The signature for the SET_UP_THIRD_PARTY function for Find modules was modified to utilize keyword arguments:
    <ul>
     <li><b>LIBS</b> (required) -- the list of libraries to be found</li>
     <li><b>LIBDIR</b> (optional) -- use when libs are located in an extension other than <i>lib64</i> or <i>lib</i></li>
     <li><b>INCDIR</b> (optional) -- use when the headers are located in an extension other than <i>include</i></li>
    </ul>
    The first argument still must be the name of the package.
  </li>
  <li>The packaging was enhanced to add the libicui18n, libicudata and libicuuc system libraries used by Qt to the lib directory. This is done automaticallly if the libraries can be found in the <i>lib64</i> directory. The packaging logic was also enhanced to add the libstdc++ libraries to the lib directory of a distribution. The libstdc++ library depends on VISIT_CXX_LIBRARY being defined. This would typically be added to the config site file and would be set if using a non-standard compiler on a system. Both of these enhancements only apply to Linux systems.</li>
  <li>The version of Mili was upgraded to 22.1.</li>
