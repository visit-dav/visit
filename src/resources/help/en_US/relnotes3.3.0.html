<a name="General_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated the ORNL host file list to include only current machines.</li>
  <li>After a successful Export database, the informational message now contains the host and path to the export.</li>
  <li>Attribute assignment (e.g. <code>cylinderAtts.point1=...</code> or <code>cylinderAtts.SetPoint1(...)</code>) operations were modified to catch and disallow nonsensical usage instead of silently falling back to default values and provide better error checkingand messaging. It is possible these changes may cause code that worked fine to now terminate with a Python exception. In such cases, the resulting error message should explain the cause of the failure and the changes required to fix it should be obvious and minimal.</li>
  <li>A new function was added to the Python CLI named <code>apropos(regex)</code> similar in purpose to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apropos_(Unix)">Unix' apropos</a>. It makes finding the names of functions and objects much easier. It will return a list of the names of functions or objects where the regular expression matches either in the method name or in the documentation string for the method or in a stringified instance (objects only). All matching is case insensitive.</li>
  <li>Default behavior of Python's <code>help(thing)</code> was adjusted slightly to first present what <code>help(thing)</code> would normally produce but then to also follow it up with output from <code>apropos(thing)</code> when that output is non-empty.<li>
  <li>The French translation was updated thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cessenat">@cessenat</a>. We are still looking for volunteers for translations in other languages. If interested, please <a href="https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/support/">contact us</a>.</li>
  <li>A new (beta) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_given_to_the_Spanish_language">Castilian Spanish</a> translation was created thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cessenat">@cessenat</a> using auto-translation from English. It likely still requires review by someone who is fluent in Spanish and we would welcome any volunteers.</li>
  <li>References to old email lists (@ornl.gov) throughout code and documentation were replaced with references to the help pages of the new website.</li>
  <li>The <code>Pick</code> operator now has the option to include the Euclidean distance between the current and previous <code>Pick</code> in the GUI's output window. To enable this option, check the <code>Distance to previous</code> box. You should then see a new field in the tabular output display titled <code>Distance to previous</code>.</li>
  <li>Support for <i>SeedMe</i> was removed since the service was retired.</li>
  <li>A section was added to the <i>Developer Manual</i> describing process launching.</li>
  <li>A section was added to the <i>Developer Manual</i> describing building VisIt with spack.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint export now supports repartitioning the mesh on output. In the Blueprint export options, select the "Partition" operation and set the target number of domains field.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint export now supports flattening the mesh data on output. In the Blueprint export options, select "Flatten_CSV" to export the mesh data to vertex and element based CSV files, or "Flatten_HDF5" to export the data to a Blueprint "Table" node.</li>
  <li>The Flatten() function has been added to the CLI; this function uses the new avtFlattenQuery to return the active plot data as a tabular, numpy compatible, 2D array.</li>
  <li>Added new mesh expressions 'logical_nodeid', 'logical_zoneid', 'node_domain', 'zone_domain', and 'zone_centers'.</li>
  <li>A tutorial on Python expressions was added to the tutorials section of the manual.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Advanced_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced Feature 1</li>
  <li>Advanced Feature 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="GUI_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes in GUI behavior for version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Custom titles for Legend annotation objects can now be set.</li> 
  <li>Dolly and FlyThrough navigation modes now support mouse-wheel interaction for zooming.</li>
  <li>Changing navigation mode (Trackball, Dolly, FlyThrough) will now trigger an automatic View reset.</li>
</ul>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">File format reader changes in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Xolotl reader was updated to support phase-space.<li>
  <li>SW4 reader was renamed as sw4img to fix static builds.<li>
  <li>NASTRAN reader was adjusted to reduce verbosity of debugX outputs and handle DOS line endings.<li>
  <li>The Blueprint reader now supports the option to choose between two different MFEM low order refinement schemes. The Legacy option is the original LOR scheme used by VisIt, and the new option preserves the continuity of meshes. The new option is enabled by default.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Plot_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's plots in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pseudocolor Plot Limits now say "Use Actual Data" instead of "Use Current Plot".</li>
  <li>Plot Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Operator_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's operators in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Operator Change 1</li>
  <li>Operator Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Expression_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's expression language in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Expression Change 1</li>
  <li>Expression Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Query_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes to VisIt's picks and queries in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Query Change 1</li>
  <li>Query Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Other bugs fixed in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug where changing the 'Number format' for a Contour plot's legend would have no affect on the labels next to the tick marks.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that prevented users from comparing particular VisIt Python objects in the CLI with non-VisIt types.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash with libsim when attempting to Export databases that have export options specified as enums.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Right-Clicking in the Viewer Window to access popup menu was preventing mouse-wheel navigation functionality until another mouse click was performed.</li>
  <li>Fixed several bugs with 'Flythrough' navigation mode: multiple calls to ResetView would make the plot disappear; adding new plots would make them disappear from view; issuing a 'Recenter View' would move the camera inside the plot.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where bounding box extents would not be reset when 'Scale 3D Axes' was turned off.</li>
  <li>Fixed a cli crash when 'DeleteAllPlots' is called when there are not plots, and a callback has been registered for 'SetActivePlots'.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in visit_composite where output formats like bmp, png could not be read back in by VisIt nor used to encode movies.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Configuration_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Configuration changes in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Configuration Change 1</li>
  <li>Configuration Change 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Build_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Build features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Build_visit was modified to do an out-of-source build for Qt.</li>
  <li>Build Feature 2</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is now a WIN32DEFINES xml tag for database plugins, used to specify preprocessor defines needed by a plugin on Windows. If the needed define comes from a thirdparty library, the Find module for that library should set a CMake var with those defines that the plugin could then use in the .xml file. See FindCGNS.cmake and CGNS.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The minimum required version of CMake is now 3.14, the version built by build_visit.</li> 
  <li>The programs qtviswinExample, qtvtkExample, qvtkopenglExample were added to help with debugging OpenGL issues.</li>
  <li>VisIt test data archive tooling was changed from 7z to tar with the same (lzma2) compression.</li>
  <li>The version of Conduit was upgraded to 0.8.2.</li>
  <li>VisIt now calculates the topological dimension of the data tree after the data has been retrieved from the database, and after SIL and/or Material selection has been applied. This should aid downstream filters that depend on an accurate topological dimension. For mixed-topology datasets the largest topological dim is what gets reported. Filters that modify topological structure are still required to update the topological dim.</li>
  <li>The DEFINES, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS tags in the xml files for plugins now support an optional "components" attribute specifying for which component(s) the tag applies. Currently valid for MDServer("M"), serial Engine ("ESer") and parallel Engine("EPar"). Multiple components may be specified, separated by commas. See ADIOS2.xml or MOAB.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The DEFINES tag now supports surrounding definitions in quotes if the quotes are important to be carried through. They must be escaped with a '\'. See uintah.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The version of MFEM was upgraded to 4.4.</li>
