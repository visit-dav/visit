<a name="General_features"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">General features added in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated the ORNL host file list to include only current machines.</li>
  <li>After a successful Export database, the informational message now contains the host and path to the export.</li>
  <li>Attribute assignment (e.g. <code>cylinderAtts.point1=...</code> or <code>cylinderAtts.SetPoint1(...)</code>) operations were modified to catch and disallow nonsensical usage instead of silently falling back to default values and provide better error checkingand messaging. It is possible these changes may cause code that worked fine to now terminate with a Python exception. In such cases, the resulting error message should explain the cause of the failure and the changes required to fix it should be obvious and minimal.</li>
  <li>A new function was added to the Python CLI named <code>apropos(regex)</code> similar in purpose to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apropos_(Unix)">Unix' apropos</a>. It makes finding the names of functions and objects much easier. It will return a list of the names of functions or objects where the regular expression matches either in the method name or in the documentation string for the method or in a stringified instance (objects only). All matching is case insensitive.</li>
  <li>Default behavior of Python's <code>help(thing)</code> was adjusted slightly to first present what <code>help(thing)</code> would normally produce but then to also follow it up with output from <code>apropos(thing)</code> when that output is non-empty.<li>
  <li>The French translation was updated thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cessenat">@cessenat</a>. We are still looking for volunteers for translations in other languages. If interested, please <a href="https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/support/">contact us</a>.</li>
  <li>A new (beta) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_given_to_the_Spanish_language">Castilian Spanish</a> translation was created thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cessenat">@cessenat</a> using auto-translation from English. It likely still requires review by someone who is fluent in Spanish and we would welcome any volunteers.</li>
  <li>References to old email lists (@ornl.gov) throughout code and documentation were replaced with references to the help pages of the new website.</li>
  <li>The <code>Pick</code> operator now has the option to include the Euclidean distance between the current and previous <code>Pick</code> in the GUI's output window. To enable this option, check the <code>Distance to previous</code> box. You should then see a new field in the tabular output display titled <code>Distance to previous</code>.</li>
  <li>Support for <i>SeedMe</i> was removed since the service was retired.</li>
  <li>A section was added to the <i>Developer Manual</i> describing process launching.</li>
  <li>A section was added to the <i>Developer Manual</i> describing building VisIt with spack.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint export now supports repartitioning the mesh on output. In the Blueprint export options, select the "Partition" operation and set the target number of domains field.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint export now supports flattening the mesh data on output. In the Blueprint export options, select "Flatten_CSV" to export the mesh data to vertex and element based CSV files, or "Flatten_HDF5" to export the data to a Blueprint "Table" node.</li>
  <li>The Flatten() function has been added to the CLI; this function uses the new avtFlattenQuery to return the active plot data as a tabular, numpy compatible, 2D array.</li>
  <li>Added new mesh expressions 'logical_nodeid', 'logical_zoneid', 'node_domain', 'zone_domain', and 'zone_centers'.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.3</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is now a WIN32DEFINES xml tag for database plugins, used to specify preprocessor defines needed by a plugin on Windows. If the needed define comes from a thirdparty library, the Find module for that library should set a CMake var with those defines that the plugin could then use in the .xml file. See FindCGNS.cmake and CGNS.xml for an example.</li>
  <li>The minimum required version of CMake is now 3.14, the version built by build_visit.</li> 
  <li>The programs qtviswinExample, qtvtkExample, qvtkopenglExample were added to help with debugging OpenGL issues.</li>
