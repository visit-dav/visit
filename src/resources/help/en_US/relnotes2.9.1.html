<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 2.9.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The meta data server no longer crashes when it attempts to open a Silo file with empty multivar variables.</li>
  <li>Performing a <i>Pick</i> operation on an expression variable that requires pipeline re-execution no longer causes an engine to crash or hang when run in parallel.</li>
  <li>The mapping of data to colors is now more accurate when using a logarithmic color mapping when applying color using texture mapping (the default).</li>
  <li>The <i>Scatter</i> plot now supports double-precision input.</li>
  <li>Picking on a plot with the <i>CoordSwap</i> operator applied to it will no longer trigger pipeline re-executions unless something else in the pipeline requires it.</li>
  <li>Nek5000 data files can now be opened correctly on Windows.</li>
  <li><i>Subset</i> plots of AMR data with the <i>OnionPeel</i> operator applied are now correct.</li>
  <li>The PFLOTRAN reader no longer causes the engine to crash when reading vector data.</li>
  <li>The <i>Threshold</i> operator attributes dialog has been updated to display small min/max field values correctly</li>
  <li>The <i>Apply color using textures</i> rendering preference is now preserved when settings are saved.</li>
  <li>The <i>Data-Level Comparsion</i> wizard now sets the variable-type of the expression being created.</li>
  <li>The <i>3D</i> tab in the <i>Annotations</i> window has been modified so that the bounding box settings can be modified even when the axes portion is turned off.</li>
  <li>A bug was fixed where plot and operator windows accepting double precision values as input would truncate and/or round numbers being entered, thus possibly causing loss of significant digits. This generally only occurred for very small numbers.</li>
  <li>Fixed a glitch with the <i>Expression</i> creation window, where text could be parsed as html. For example, "&lt;P&gt;" became a new paragraph.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where operations involving double precision vector data could crash or hang the compute engine when running in parallel.</li> 
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.9.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A <i>parallel mxterm</i> launch profile was added to many of the LLNL host profiles. Using the <i>parallel mxterm</i> launch profile will allow users to easily run parallel jobs when launching VisIt from within an mxterm.</li>
  <li>VisIt's XDMF reader can now read XDMF files that consist of a top level Grid collection containing intermediate grid collections and each of those contains a single grid.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.9.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>--nektar++</i> option to build_visit was renamed to <i>--nektarpp</i> to avoid problems with some shells in dealing with the <i>++</i> in function names.</li>
</ul>
