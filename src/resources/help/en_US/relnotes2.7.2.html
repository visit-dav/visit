<ul>
<li>Creating database correlations on Windows from the CLI, when databases are opened using relative paths, has been fixed.</li>
<li>Session files with time varying data can be restored via the CLI with different sources and have their time sliders work correctly.</li>
<li>An engine crash on Windows was fixed when cmfe expressions were passed an invalid filename.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed where a plot got put in perpetual 'pending' state when NamedSelections' 'Automatially apply updated selections' was checked before the selection had been applied to a plot.</li>
<li>VisIt's Annotation window has been fixed so that it is once again possible to select axis tick marks that are both inside and outside of the 3D bounding box.</li>
<li>The silent uninstall option on Windows (/S from command-line) now works again.</li>
<li>A problem with material selection in plots from files containing a mix of multi-block and single-block meshes at the same dir-level and also containing standard block grouping was corrected (<a href="https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/877">ticket #877</a>) .</li>
<li>The internallauncher was modified to correct a bug where the -N option was improperly set when using aprun to launch VisIt. Thanks Jean Favre for the fix.</li>

<li>Making movies with movie templates works again on Windows.</li>
<li>A small number of errors were fixed in the visit-install script. The "arl" and "asu" configurations are now supported with the "-c" option. The help text is now up-to-date and the configuration options are now listed in alphabetical order.</li>
<li>The ADIOS reader was fixed so that it now properly reads 3D uniform and rectilinear meshes.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed with a previous fix to the OnionPeel operater in VisIt 2.7.1 where it didn't properly handle the case where the seed cell was specified as a global cell number and material interface reconstruction was applied.</li>

</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 2.7.2</font></b></p>

</ul>

<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 2.7.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The build_visit script was modified to build MPICH 3.0.4 instead of 3.0.1 so that MPICH would build on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 systems.</li>
<li>The build_visit script was modified so that the MPICH library it builds is compatible with the Uintah library.</li>
<li>The build system was modified to add -DMPI_NO_CPPBIND and -DMPICH_SKIP_MPICXX to VISIT_PARALLEL_CFLAGS and VISIT_PARALLEL_CXXFLAGS so that the xdmf_writer sample programs could be built with more versions of MPI.</li>
