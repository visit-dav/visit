ExternalSurface operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ExternalSurface operator takes the input mesh and calculates its external 
faces and outputs polygonal data. The ExternalSurface operator is not enabled 
by default but it can be turned on in the **Plugin Manager Window**. The 
ExternalSurface operator can be useful when creating plots that only involve 
the external geometry of a plot - such as when you create a Vector plot of 
surface normals.
