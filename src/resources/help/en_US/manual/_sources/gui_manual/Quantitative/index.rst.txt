Quantitative Analysis
=====================

Simulation data must often be compared to experimental data so VisIt provides
a number of features that allow quantitative information to be extracted from
simulation databases. This chapter explains how to visualize derived variables
created with expressions and query information about a database. This chapter
also explains VisIt's Pick, Query and Lineout capabilities which allow users
to compute highly sophisticated quantitative, as opposed to visual, results.
