Visualization Windows
=====================

A visualization window, also known as a vis window, is a window that
displays plots and allows you to interact with them using the mouse. The
vis window not only allows for direct manipulation of plots but it also
provides a popup menu and toolbar that allow you to switch window modes,
activate interactive tools, and perform commonly used operations. This
chapter explains how to manage and use vis windows.
