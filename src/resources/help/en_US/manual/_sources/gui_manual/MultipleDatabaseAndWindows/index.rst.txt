Multiple Databases and Windows
==============================

In this chapter, we discuss how to use VisIt to visualize multiple databases
using either a single window or multiple visualization windows that have
been locked together. After a general discussion of databases, we move to
database correlation, which is used to relate multiple time-varying 
databases together in some fashion. The use of database correlations will be 
explained in detail followed by a description of database comparisons, then 
common useful operations involving multiple visualization windows.
