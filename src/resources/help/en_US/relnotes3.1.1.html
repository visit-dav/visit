<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.1.1</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Corrected a bug where certain types of mili datasets would cause unexpected crashes.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where the Data level comparison wizard would always enter zero for the simulation cycle.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where zone pick highlights were incorrect after transforms were applied.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug summing mesh_quality/volume in a sub-material setting.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt crashes on start-up on some Windows systems when the system OpenGL version is too old.

  <li>Corrected a bug performing QueryOverTime with plots involving operator-created expressions.</li>
