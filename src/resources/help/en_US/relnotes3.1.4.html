<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.1.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that resulted in domain boundaries being visible when using the OSPRay volume renderer.</li>
  <li>Fixed display of -help text on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused incorrect opacity attenuation when ray casting datasets within very large or very small ranges.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the Hohlraum Flux query, where a ray would not be traced properly resulting in a compute engine crash. Those cases are now detected and the ray is ignored. Since this happens in extremely rare situations, this does not have a significant effect on the result.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Pick Through Time from working with expressions that relied on mesh information.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the launcher script where the bank was not passed when launching with srun.</li>
  <li>Modified the startup script to remove the code that unsetenv LD_PRELOAD since it was causing VisIt to fail at sites that were using LD_PRELOAD for VisIt to work properly. If you need to unsetenv LD_PRELOAD, it should be done in the custom launcher script, an example of which can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/blob/develop/src/resources/hosts/llnl/customlauncher">LLNL customlauncher</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 3.1.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Enabled the paraDIS and paraDIS_tecplot readers on Windows.</li>
  <li>It is now possible to easily run VisIt in parallel with all the Linux distributions. To run in parallel, simply pass the number of processors to use with the "-np" command line option. For example, "visit -np 4" to run on 4 processors.</li>
  <li>Removed the host profiles for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Max, Sequoia and Shark systems.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.1.4</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated build_visit scripts for macOS 10.15</li>
  <li>Removed fastbit and fastquery from build visit support because VisIt no longer uses these libraries.</li>
</ul>
