<p>Welcome to VisIt's main help page.
VisIt is a distributed, parallel, visualization tool for visualizing data defined on two- and three-dimensional structured and unstructured meshes. VisIt's 
distributed architecture allows it to leverage both the compute power of a large 
parallel computer and the graphics acceleration hardware of a local workstation. 
Another benefit of the distributed architecture is that VisIt can visualize the 
data where it is generated, eliminating the need to move the data. VisIt can be 
controlled by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or through the Python or Java  
programming languages.</p>

    <td width="40%" bgColor="#ccccff">VisIt’s visualization capabilities are 
    primarily grouped into two categories:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Plots </b>are 
      used to visualize data and include Boundary, Contour, Curve, Mesh, 
      Pseudocolor, Scatter, Streamline, Surface, Tensor, Truecolor, Vector, and 
      Volume.</li>
      <li><b>Operators</b> 
      transform the data prior to visualization. Some examples include Slice, 
      Index select, Iso-surface, Onion peel, Reflect, Threshold. See the chapter 
      on operators for the complete list of operators that VisIt supports.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>VisIt handles 2D and 3D data equally well. VisIt also has the ability to 
    animate data, allowing users to see the time evolution of their data. </td>

    without the help of any translator utility. Some examples of the data file 
    formats that VisIt can read are: Alias Wavefront OBJ, BOV, Boxlib, Ensight 
    Gold, ESRI Shapefile, Exodus, Image (<i>bmp, jpeg, png, rgb, tiff</i>), 
    PLOT3D, SAMRAI, SAR, Silo, Spheral, STL, TecPlot, VTK. VisIt reads many more 
    types of files and can easily be extended to read other types of files by 
    writing database reader plugins.</td>

    <td width="20%" bgColor="#ccccff">VisIt is also a powerful analysis tool. It 
    provides support for derived fields, which allow new fields to be calculated 
    using existing fields. For example, if a dataset contains a velocity field, 
    it is possible to define a new field that is the velocity magnitude. VisIt’s 
    quantitative analysis tools include:<ul>
      <li>Line-out, which 
      allows you to create curves from higher dimensional datasets by 
      interactively defining lines using the mouse. </li>
      <li>Pick and query, 
      which allows you to query the dataset by clicking on images. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>VisIt also supports a generalized query interface, which allows you to 
    query derived quantities such as volume or surface area.</td>

    allowing power users access to advanced features. VisIt automatically 
    creates time-based animations from data sets that contain multiple time 
    steps. In addition, it also has a keyframe animation capability that allows 
    users to create sophisticated animations. VisIt allows users to pan, zoom, 
    and rotate objects interactively using the mouse. It also gives users the 
    ability to interactively size and position geometric objects such as planes 
    and spheres.</td>

    in order to handle extremely large data sets interactively. VisIt’s 
    rendering and data processing capabilities are split into viewer and engine 
    components that may be distributed across multiple machines:<ul>
      <li>Viewer—Responsible for rendering and is typically run on a local 
      desktop or visualization server so that it can leverage the extremely 
      powerful graphics cards that have been developed in the last few years.
      </li>
      <li>Engine—Responsible for the bulk of the data processing and 
      input/output (I/O) and is typically run on a remote machine where the data 
      is located. This eliminates the need move the data and makes high-end 
      compute and I/O resources available to it. The engine can be run serially 
      on a single processor or in parallel on thousands of processors. </li>

    <td bgColor="#ccccff">Interfaces with C++, Python, and Java</td>

    The C++ and Java interfaces make it possible to provide alternate user 
    interfaces for VisIt or allow existing C++ or Java applications to add 
    visualization support. The Python scripting interface gives users the 
    ability to batch process data using a powerful scripting language. This 
    feature can be used to create extremely sophisticated animations or 
    implement regression suites. It also allows simulation systems that use 
    Python as a back-plane to easily integrate visualization capabilities into 
    their systems. </td>

  <tr vAlign="top">
    <td bgColor="#ccccff">Extensible with dynamically loaded plug-ins</td>
    <td bgColor="#ccccff">VisIt achieves extensibility through the use of 
    dynamically loaded plugins. All of VisIt’s plots, operators, and database 
    readers are implemented as plugins and are loaded at run-time from the 
    plugin directory. New plugins can be added simply by installing them in this 
    directory. VisIt comes with a graphical plugin creation tool, which greatly 
    simplifies the process of creating new plugins. The user describes the 
    properties of the plugin and then the tool generates most of the code 
    necessary to implement the plugin. For example, in the case of an operator, 
    the plugin creation tool creates the code necessary for the graphical user 
    interface attribute window; the C++, Python, and Java interfaces; and the 
    code necessary to interface to VisIt. The only code you need to write is the 
    C++ code that actually performs the operation.</td>
