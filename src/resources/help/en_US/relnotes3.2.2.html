  <li>Fixed a bug in the Blueprint reader that caused unnecessary copies of topology connectivity arrays.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Blueprint reader where YAML or JSON root files were rewritten on open, which could strip comments and change the file entires. The root file is now opened in a read only mode.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where versions of VisIt that supported hardware accelerated rendering would display a black image in the visualization window.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash when saving images greater than approximately 8,000 x 8,000. Now images can be saved up to 16,384 x 16,384.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the <i>Chombo Users</i> configuration that prevented the macros from being loaded and appearing in the "Macros" window.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where VisIt would hang when connecting to a remote system running Linux when connecting from a Linux or macOS system.</li>
  <li>The path is now stripped off the filename in the Pick output to be consistent with output on linux.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug with Pick for Rectilinear grids when real zones are completely surrounded by ghost zones.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where VisIt would hang when working with a AMR meshes and the number of active patches was less than the number of processors and the patches were not rectilinear.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where encoding an mpeg movie on an Ubuntu 21 system failed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Uintah reader where long64 data was read as zeroes. This primarily impacted particle ids.</li>
