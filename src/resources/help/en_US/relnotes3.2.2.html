<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.2.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Blueprint Database Plugin where YAML or JSON root files were rewritten on open, which could strip comments and change the file entires. The root file is now opened in a read only mode.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where versions of VisIt that supported hardware accelerated rendering would display a black image in the visualization window.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash when saving images greater than approximately 8,000 x 8,000. Now images can be saved up to 16,384 x 16,384.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the <i>Chombo Users</i> configuration that prevented the macros from being loaded and appearing in the "Macros" window.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where VisIt would hang when connecting to a remote system running Linux when connecting from a Linux or macOS system.</li>
  <li>Pick output of filename on Windows has been made consistent with output for linux: path is stripped off.</li>
  <li>Command recording for GlobalLineoutAttributes now works correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed pick failure for Rectilinear grids when real zones are completely surrounded by ghost zones.</li>
</ul>
