<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.4.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug where user supplied legend labels were stored in config and session files wrapped in '()' and comma separated. This prevented the values from being parsed correctly and the '()' and commas appeared as part of the labels.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Blueprint reader causing it to handle unstructured topologies built on uniform coordinate sets incorrectly.</li>
  <li>The location where custom plugins are written when built against installed version of VisIt was corrected.</li>
  <li>Windows build issues for custom plugins against an installed version of VisIt was fixed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in OpenPMD reader that subverted its ability to read chunked, as opposed to contiguous datasets.</li>
  <li>Enabled "Tunnel data connections through SSH" in the LLNL RZ host profiles where it was missing.</li>
  <li>Removed the obsolete LLNL host profiles for RZTopaz, Surface and Vulcan.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the LLNL host profiles for Boraxo, Dane and Ruby didn't get installed in some situations.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with rendering transparent surfaces with scalable rendering resulting in images with black horizontal bars or missing surface fragments.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues with build_visit when using gcc-13 and when Qt6 is present on the system.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with Volume plot when SILRestriction applied, and when Composite rendering caused problem when a different RendererType used directly afterwards.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint writer no longer writes the wrong path to root files when specifying a directory to export files to.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint writer now correctly puts the right cycle number in file names.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in zonetype-label expression where unknown zone types would render a weird symbol, <code>&quot;?</code>.</li>
  <li>Disabled warning message regarding skipping of speculative expression generation for databases with many variables. For more information, read our documentation about <a href="https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using_visit/Quantitative/Expressions.html#automatic-expressions">automatic expressions</a>.</li>
  <li>Forced VTK file exports to use VTK data file format 4.2 instead of the new, not backwards compatible 5.1.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the opaque geometry in an image containing both opaque and transparent geometry wouldn't be rendered poperly when rendered using scalable rendering.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where saving an image with transparent geometry would hang when using scalable rendering.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where perspective mode set to `off` in config files would not be restored correctly.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Enhancements"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Enhancements in version 3.4.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Qt6 is now the default version of Qt that is built with VisIt.</li>
  <li>The color table button (available in plot/operator windows), has a new option 'More Color Tables ...' which will open the Color Table Windows to easier find more options.</li>
  <li>A host profile has been added for running on LLNL's RZVernal system.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint reader and writer now supports mixed element topologies.</li>
  <li>The <code>VISIT_VERSION_GE()</code> macro useful in detecting the VisIt version being used at compile time has been made public in its own header file, <code>visit-version.h</code>, which is found in <code>VISIT_INSTALL/include/visit/include</code>.</li>
  <li>The Blueprint writer lets users specify Blueprint write options.</li>
  <li>The expression system now supports the <code>%</code> binary modulo operator. The <code>mod()</code> expression function is still supported but has been generalized to use the <code>fmod()</code> function from the C/C++ math library as does the new <code>%</code> binary operator.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where hdf5_hl library wouldn't always be installed with VisIt.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with Pseudocolor plots of datasets with very large or small extents being rendered black.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Dev_changes"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Changes for VisIt developers in version 3.4.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated Conduit to 0.9.2.</li>
  <li>Docker containers were added for RockyLinux (RHEL compatible).</li>
  <li>Qwt is now optional. Historically, it has only ever been needed for advanced GUI features of LibSimV2 interface. Add <code>--qwt</code> to the build_visit command line to build qwt. Add <code>--system-qwt</code> to have VisIt attempt to find and use a system version of Qwt.  Add <code>--alt-qwt-dir /path/to/qwt/install</code> to use a pre-built version of Qwt installed somewhere else.</li>
  <li>Added ICE-T support for Windows builds.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where printing the build_visit log file location prepended extra paths.</li>
  <li>Fixed glitch that prevented VISIT_CXX_FLAGS defined in config-site file from being applied.</li>
</ul>
