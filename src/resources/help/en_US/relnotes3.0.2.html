<a name="Bugs_fixed"></a>
<p><b><font size="4">Bugs fixed in version 3.0.2</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Corrected a bug where VisIt would crash when attempting to use python expressions with other expressions as inputs.</li>
  <li>Corrected a launch failure on Windows when 8dot3name (shortnames) is disabled on the system.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the mili plugin not handling integers in scientific notation.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the Uintah reader not being able to read index.xml files.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with importing remote profiles, where it looked at the old Subversion repository for remote profiles. Now it looks at the new Git repository.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where bringing up the Elevate attributes window would crash the graphical user interface on OSX.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with the Uintah reader where it would not load because the libxml2 could not be found.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where the GUI plot list goes blank on macOS.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where the VTK reader incorrectly set topological dimension of a dataset to 0, making the dataset undrawable by VisIt. This occured in a multiblock case where the first block contained neither points nor cells.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug with highlighting zones picked by their global ids. The highlighted cells were incorrect or non-existent before.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug where the OriginalZoneLabels and OriginalNodeLabels variables appeared twice in the menu for Mili files.</li>
  <li>Corrected a viewer crash when glyphed points were scaled by a tensor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Host profiles were added for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit system.</li>
  <li>Tables in the graphical user interface documentation that ran off the edge of the page have been converted to definition lists.</li>

  <li>Openssl was added to the list of required libraries in build_visit.</li> 
  <li>Added the turbo color table.</li> 
  <li>The XYZ writer replaces '?' with UNKNOWN_ATOMIC_ELEMENT and now warns the user if the dataset is not effectively point-centered.</li>
  <li>The Xdmf reader now supports time-varying grid counts via a top-level &lt;Information Name="TimeVaryingMetaData" Value="True"/&gt; node in the Xdmf file.</li>
  <li>Added a reader for Xolotl files. Xolotl is an open-source, high performance plasma-surface interactions simulator that is under development with the DOE's SciDAC program. VisIt will automatically recognize files that end with the extention ".xolotl" as Xolotl files.</li>
