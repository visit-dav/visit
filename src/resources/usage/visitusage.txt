                             session for every timestep of the database.

    Startup options

        -o <filename>        Open the specified data file at startup.
        -s <filename>        Run the specified VisIt script. Note: This
                             argument only takes effect with -cli or -movie.
        -sessionfile <filename>  Open the specified session file at startup
                             Note that this argument only takes effect with
                             -gui or -movie.
        -config <filename>   Initialize the viewer at startup using the named
                             config file.  If an absolute path is not given,
                             the file is assumed to be in the .visit directory.
        -noconfig            Don't process configuration files at startup.
        -launchengine <host> Launch an engine at startup. The <host> parameter

                             will be launched on the local host. If you wish
                             to launch an engine on a remote host, specify 
                             the host's name as the <host> parameter.
        -nosplash            Do not display the splash screen at startup.

    Window options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -small               Use a smaller desktop area/window size.
        -geometry <spec>     What portion of the screen to use.  This is a
                             standard X Windows geometry specification. This
                             option can be used to set the size of images
                             generated from scripts and movies.

        -viewer_geometry <spec> What portion of the screen the viewer windows
                                will use. This is a standard X Windows geometry
                                specification. This option overrides the
                                -geometry option that the GUI passes to the
                                viewer.

        -window_anchor <x,y> The x,y position on the screen where VisIt's GUI
                             will show its windows (Main window excluded).
        -style <style>       One of: Windows,Fusion. If more options are
                             available, they will be listed in the gui
                             under Options->Appearance.
        -locale <locale>     The locale that you want VisIt to use when displaying
                             translated menus and controls. VisIt will use the
                             default locale if the -locale option is not
                             provided.
        -background <color>  Background color for GUI.
        -foreground <color>  Foreground color for GUI.
        -nowin               Run with viewer windows off-screen (i.e. OSMesa).
                             This is typically used with the -cli option.
        -stereo              Enable active stereo, also known as the
                             page-flipping, or 'CrystalEyes' mode.
        -nowindowmetrics     Prevents X11 from grabbing and moving a test
                             widget used in calculating window borders. This
                             option can be useful if VisIt hangs when 
                             displaying to an Apple X-server.

    Version options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -version             Do NOT run VisIt. Just print the current version.
        -git_revision        Do NOT run VisIt. Just print the Git revision
                             number it was built from.
        -beta                Run the current beta version.
        -v <version>         Run a specified version. Specifying 2 digits,
                             such as X.Y, will run the latest patch release
                             for that version. Specifying 3 digits, such as
                             X.Y.Z, will run that specific version.
