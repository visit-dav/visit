# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jun 25 21:31:15 PDT 2001
#    Added _ser or _par extension to library names.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 23 00:41:31 PDT 2001
#    Added some required libraries for AIX.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:36:31 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Dec 19 13:24:34 PST 2001
#    Removed VTK dependency.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 16 09:52:05 PST 2002
#    Make this library have one version, not different ser/par versions.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Mar 11 16:44:39 PST 2002
#    Made this library build in one pass from this directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul  3 13:23:04 PDT 2002
#    Added SUBDIRS back in.  It was still needed.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Nov 14 17:05:58 PST 2002
#    Added avtSILMatrix.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Aug 5 9:38:34 PDT 2003
#    I removed an old Silo dependency.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 22 14:10:31 PST 2004
#    I added -lcomm and -lparser since avtDatabaseMetadata needs those
#    libraries.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Aug 12 11:41:14 PDT 2004
#    I added avtSimulationInformation.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Jan 4 17:31:58 PST 2005
#    I added -lexpr so it links on MacOS X.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Mar 18 16:23:13 PST 2005
#    Added avtSimulationCommandSpecification.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Mar 7 15:27:41 PST 2007
#    Added new metadata objects resulting from code autogeneration.
#
#    Dave Bremer, Wed Dec 19 12:33:29 PST 2007
#    Added avtSILArray.C to the build.
