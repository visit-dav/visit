#   Added Zoo MIR.
#
#   Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 22 15:47:15 PST 2004
#   I added more libraries so it links completely for prebinding on MacOS X.
#
#   Brad Whitlock, Tue Jan 4 17:43:58 PST 2005
#   I added -lexpr for MacOS X.
#
#   Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 29 11:35:19 PDT 2005
#   I made it be ser/par for parallel build on MacOS X.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Aug 18 17:13:02 PDT 2005
#   Split cell reconstructor into a recursive and an isovolume version.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Nov 10 14:55:30 PST 2005
#   Removed automatic dependencies for mat3d_tet stuff.  It was getting
#   triggered accidentally on occasion and trying to rebuild read-only files
#   in the VOB.  It never changes anymore anyway.....
#
#   Brad Whitlock, Thu Jan 26 15:30:52 PST 2006
#   Added libs for MacOS X.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Wed Feb  7 17:53:04 PST 2007
#    Added $(GLEW_LIBS) for MacOS X.
