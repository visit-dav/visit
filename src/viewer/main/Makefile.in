# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug  4 16:42:44 PDT 2000
#    Changed source listing to use SRC=$(OBJ:.o=.C).  This allows parsing
#    of this Makefile.in for object files inside configure.
#    Cleaned up some stuff, too.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug  8 13:45:29 PDT 2000
#    Added shared .o files as dependencies of the binaries.  Also, added
#    targets for all the shared .o files to prevent trying to rebuild
#    them.  It cannot do it correctly automatically.

#    use the viewer proxy.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep  7 13:17:08 PDT 2000
#    Added the new engine RPCs.

#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Jan 31 09:54:48 PST 2001
#    Add utility library since some of the volume rendered stuff relies on it.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Feb 26 16:40:20 PST 2001
#    I moved all the plot specific files to the plot directory.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Mar 15 08:36:40 PST 2001
#    Removed unused Silo libraries.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Tue Mar 13 08:32:34 PST 2001

#    viewer specific portion of the plugin manager.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Mar 28 14:07:51 PST 2001
#    Renamed -lplot to be a viewer specific set of plugins.

#    Added @PX@ to libplugin.  Made "make clean" remove viewer.o.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:31:52 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon Sep 24 14:40:27 PDT 2001

#    Added vtkqt to the include path.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Mar 13 14:08:03 PST 2002
#    I removed support for the qgl library since we now only support Qt 2.3.x
#    and later which does not have that library.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Mar 26 15:21:27 PST 2002
#    I removed the rpc library.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Thu Apr 18 13:37:45 PDT 2002
#    Retrofitted to use Jeremy's parser.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri May 3 17:16:19 PST 2002

#    I removed ViewerPalette.{C,h} and ViewerColorTables.{C,h}
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Jan 29 13:56:14 PST 2003
#    I added source files for toolbar actions.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Feb  5 09:06:10 PST 2003

#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Jun 26 23:29:07 PDT 2003
#    Link against the expressions library -- this is very unfortunate, but
#    necessary for the way we have plots set up now.  The Histogram plot
#    uses the histogram filter, which uses an expression.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Wed Jul  2 14:41:46 PDT 2003
#    Removed the link against the expressions library.  This fails with my
#    new expressions engine.

#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Mar 30 10:16:44 PST 2004
#    Added EngineKey.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Apr 9 09:09:28 PDT 2004
#    Moved moc files into viewer proper.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 24 21:28:02 PDT 2004
#    Added metadata and SIL observers.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Aug 30 18:05:21 PDT 2004

#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Nov 23 14:53:07 PST 2004

#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Mar 7 17:53:45 PST 2006

#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Sep 15 16:43:17 PST 2006
#    Added libGLEW.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Sun Dec  3 12:20:11 PST 2006
#    Added FILIB_LIBS
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Feb 12 12:14:30 PDT 2007
#    Moved ViewerState to the rpc lib and added ViewerBase here.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jan 25 14:05:03 PST 2007
#    Added ViewerCommandFromSimObserver.C
#
#    Eric Brugger, Tue Mar 20 11:33:29 PDT 2007
#    Added MesaStub and GL_LIBS to the list of VTK libraries since VTK_LIBS
#    no longer includes MESA_LIBS and GL_LIBS and I am replacing the mesa
#    libraries with MesaStub in the viewer.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Mon Apr  2 17:26:29 PDT 2007
#    Using configure generated VIEWER_MESA_LIBS, as determined by
#    --enable-viewer-mesa-stub
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jun  4 14:40:21 EDT 2007
#    Added a SRC= definition.  Automatic ("gnu") dependency generation
#    depends on this containing a full list of source files in this directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jun  5 17:26:11 EDT 2007
#    Added an ALLOBJ= definition.  This is for updated dependency generation.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jun  7 13:23:18 EDT 2007
#    Build rules for _moc.C are now in make-targets.in. Remove them from here.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sun Nov 11 12:57:03 PST 2007
#    Added ViewerChangeUsernameWindow.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Nov 21 14:54:43 PST 2007
#    Made ViewerServerManager get fed through moc since it now has a slot.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jan  4 13:31:01 EST 2008
#    Added VIEWER_MESA_STUB_CPPFLAGS back into CPPFLAGS.  They were
#    clobbered some time in the past.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Aug 18 13:18:27 PDT 2008
#    Added VisItViewer and changed rules for building the viewer library.
#    Nearly everything goes into libviewer now so we can use the viewer
#    in other applications.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Oct 3 10:35:38 EDT 2008
#    Added avtIVP to the link line.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Jan 27 18:03:23 PST 2009
#    Removed refs to $(FILIB) which was for the FAST INTERVAL LIBRARY and
#    was replaced by some Boost builtin libs.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Jun 30 20:02:20 MDT 2009
#    Add define for proper symbol export.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Thu Jul  2 01:52:50 MDT 2009
#    Comm needs to be exported since we throw one of its exceptions.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Nov  4 12:30:35 PST 2009
#    I removed some libraries.
