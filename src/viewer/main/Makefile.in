# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug  4 16:42:44 PDT 2000
#    Changed source listing to use SRC=$(OBJ:.o=.C).  This allows parsing
#    of this Makefile.in for object files inside configure.
#    Cleaned up some stuff, too.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug  8 13:45:29 PDT 2000
#    Added shared .o files as dependencies of the binaries.  Also, added
#    targets for all the shared .o files to prevent trying to rebuild
#    them.  It cannot do it correctly automatically.

#    viewer specific portion of the plugin manager.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Mar 28 14:07:51 PST 2001

#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 10:31:52 PDT 2001
#    Changed library building: the LIB targets has no extension, and
#    either LIBSINGLETARGETS or LIBMULTITARGETS must be included
#    in addition to TARGETS depending on whether the library is build
#    from object files in one directory or multiple subdirectories.

#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Mar 13 14:08:03 PST 2002

#    and later which does not have that library.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Mar 26 15:21:27 PST 2002
#    I removed the rpc library.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Thu Apr 18 13:37:45 PDT 2002

#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Jun 26 23:29:07 PDT 2003
#    Link against the expressions library -- this is very unfortunate, but
#    necessary for the way we have plots set up now.  The Histogram plot
#    uses the histogram filter, which uses an expression.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Wed Jul  2 14:41:46 PDT 2003
#    Removed the link against the expressions library.  This fails with my
#    new expressions engine.
#

#    Changed link-line to accomodate library re-organization.
