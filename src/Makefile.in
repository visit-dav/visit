#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Thu Oct 12 11:07:22 PDT 2000

#    Removed directory tools from list of subdirectories to build.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Feb 16 13:08:59 PST 2001
#    I moved the line continuation character for the SUBDIRS variable so
#    that we don't have the situation where we have a line continuation
#    with no contuation line.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Feb 26 15:44:11 PST 2001
#    I modified the makefile to compile the files in the plot directory tree.
#

#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Aug 24 13:01:54 PDT 2001

#    Added the splash screen.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Sun Jul 8 15:05:34 PST 2001
#    Added visitpy directory.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 16 13:05:30 PST 2002
#    Removed parclean target since serial and parallel now build concurrently.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon Jun 10 16:40:29 PDT 2002
#    Got rid of RSUBDIRS.  Gutted portions so as to move to a central location.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul 12 14:38:14 PDT 2002
#    Added bin and include to the subdirectories.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 15 00:56:14 PDT 2002

#    I removed the splashscreen.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Thu Nov 20 10:04:46 PST 2003
#    I made the build in the help directory optional.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 22 11:38:06 PDT 2004
#    I moved common/winutil to the top level because of some dependencies
#    on the components directory. I did this because of prebinding on the
#    Mac.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Fri Dec  2 00:11:45 PST 2005
#    Added third_party_builtin directory
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Dec  7 14:02:41 PST 2005
#    Changed order of SUBDIRS so third_party_builtin is built first, not last

#    I made sim be built before plugins since the SimV2 reader has a
#    dependency on libsimV2runtime.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Mar  4 18:02:00 PST 2009
#    Made it work for dbio-only build.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Jun 3 15:45:55 PST 2009
#    I added an engine-only build option.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Jun 16 15:32:47 PDT 2009
