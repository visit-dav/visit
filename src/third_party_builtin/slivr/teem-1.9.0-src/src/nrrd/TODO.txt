get back verbose IO messages about fread-vs-directIO

call fflush(file) before airDioTest() ? 
remove calls to nrrdPeripheral*: starting at apply1D.c
line 398 histogram.c - finish that thought
sampleUnits map to histogram axis with all things histo

enable imagemagick-style format flagging on filenames ("PNM:-"),
thereby obviating "unu save -f pnm" steps in pipes to standard out 

support TIFF format
support Analyze format
support FITS format

to expand multiple-format handling: in nrrdRead(), generalize
_nrrdOneLine to some more generation _nrrdReadStart, which puts some
portion of the read file into nio.  Th various formats' readTest()
methods need to look at that content, possibly reading in more of the
file, in order to see if they will accept the file one of their own.
The nrrdFormatAll array (or whatever its been renamed to) may need some
care in how the formats are ordered, so that if a given filename could
belong to more than one format (for writing) or if the initial content
of a filename could be in more than one format (for reading), then 
perhaps the ordering of nrrdFormatAll would impose some preferential
ordering on the formats.

unu heq should not DIE if min==max, it should just be a no-op.
unu heq -s 2 shouldn't DIE if there are only 2 bins with any hits

follow heq with clamp so that there's no value wrap-around
(noticed this with unu heq -a -1)

test working with nout==nin
nrrdContentSet
nrrdConvert
nrrdQuantize
nrrdUnquantize

test regular and irregular colormaps with only 2 points, purify unu
{lut, rmap, imap} with scalar and nonscalar, type same and different
than map type.

check resampler getting info with NULL kernel on each axis
(bug that Joe and I had with qbert when no resmapling was needed)

write a select() function to replace qsort() in median calculation

be sure to test all non-boolean state/default variables

add one-line descriptions to function declarations in nrrd.h

fftw integration!!

2D rmaps

see if the use of airSinglePrintf in accessors.c, with %.8g or whatever,
is really the right thing to do in the most general case

see which of the nrrdDef* variables are actually used, but this
is harder than just grepping through files for the nrrdDef* name;
you have to see where the variable is used that initially is set
to the nrrdDef* value.

Bricking!

kernels: teach them their derivatives, or if they are derivatives,
and how accurate they are.  Perhaps kernels don't actually belong in nrrd.

split?  (reverse of join)

clarify and document all IO stuff

other encodings- base 85

no other big things for nrrd planned...

----- Teem 1.7 cut-off -----

test suite

make movies from volumes of RGB

make nrrdDescribe() a little prettier

create textual representation of resampling parameters

revisit resampler, one last time
go through all functions to:
- determine when nin can == nout
- pass "content" correctly
- make sure content adjustment agrees with unrrdu

try setting NRRD_DIM_MAX to 2 or 3 and doing lots of unrrdu stuff

determine which of the things below should be transferred to rules.txt

verify behavior WRT min/max/center:
  reorder.c, measr.c, histogram.c, map.c, arith.c, filt.c
verify behavior WRT blocks:
  all
verify that all axis and nrrd fields are accounted for
  all functions making a "nout" from a "nin"
 
debug and scrutinize current implementation of all "nhdr" related behavior

clarify policy regarding when data in the nrrd will be free()ed

determine a consistent policy regarding assumptions and expections
surrounding use of the min and max fields, perhaps also oldMin and oldMax

try to enforce the policy that variables which exist solely to be
a local copy of values in nrrds should be **eliminated**.  This
simplifies understanding how a procedure works.

where does nrrd check to see it got a reasonable axis size,
how and when does nrrd set the default size to 0
