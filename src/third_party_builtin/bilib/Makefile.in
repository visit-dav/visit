#    Eric Brugger, Fri Jun 29 09:19:23 PDT 2007
#    Removed the setting of the DISTRIB variable.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Sep  7 13:18:56 EDT 2007
#    Don't remove the boost header files in make clean, just distclean.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Mon Jun 15 22:22:46 PDT 2009
#    Removed @LIBTARGETS@ line. It was not needed anyway and caused problems
#    for SUSE make-3.8x.
