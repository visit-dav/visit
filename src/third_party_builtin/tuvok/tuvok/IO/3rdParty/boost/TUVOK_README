This is a small and relatively arbitrary subset of the Boost libraries which we
have found useful in developing Tuvok.  The full Boost distribution is
available online:

  http://www.boost.org/

If you want to use any of this code in your own software, we strongly
discourage you from using this version of the source.  Tuvok and Boost are
distributed under different but compatible license; for more details, visit
  http://www.boost.org/users/license.html
for more information.

Please report issues with this code to the Tuvok development team, NOT the
Boost library maintainers!
