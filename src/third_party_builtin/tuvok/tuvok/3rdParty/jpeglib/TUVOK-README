This is a subset of the IJG's JPEG library, version 6, with some additional
patches for reading lossless JPEGs, and some other modifications taken from the
GDCM library.  The IJG library can be found at:

  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

The applied patch can be found at:

  ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick/delegates/ljpeg-6b.tar.gz

The GDCM homepage is:

  http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/

We strongly discourage you from using the version that exists here in
your own software.  You probably want to download the full IJG source
distribution and use that.  If you have a particular need to read
losslessly-encoded JPEGs, the aforementioned patch or GDCM's version of
the library would be of use to you.  Do note that (so far) we have only
encountered such images in evil DICOM files, so if you're wondering
whether or not you need the patch in your application, you probably
don't.

Tuvok and IJG are distributed under different but compatible licenses.  See the
README document in this directory for details.
