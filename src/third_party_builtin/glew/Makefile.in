#    Removed the setting of the DISTRIB and NOT_DISTRIB variables.

#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep  6 16:07:44 EDT 2007
#    Only remove files needed to generate dependencies when we execute
#    the 'distclean' target, not the 'clean' target.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Sat Jun 21 16:18:24 EDT 2008
#    Made the glew include directory a symlink instead of a copy, preventing
#    it from ever being partially copied.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Sun Jun 22 10:50:21 EDT 2008
#    Oops, path was wrong.  Also removed a useless `cd'.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Oct 10 15:07:49 PST 2008
#    Remove the glew link on make clean.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Wed Mar 18 20:56:48 MST 2009
#    Updated the version of GLEW; tarball name changed.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Sat Jul 25 17:34:02 MDT 2009
#    Update how we handle GLEW: don't rely on a tarball.
