#                  Run VisIt on various architectures
#
# Programmer:  Jeremy Meredith
# Date      :  December  9, 2004
#
# NOTE: forked from what is now the "legacylauncher" script; look there
#       for old comments and version tree history
#
# NOTE: this file is version-specific; feel free to put non-backwards
#       compatible code in here and remove things which might break on
#       old versions
#
# Modifications:
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Dec  9 16:32:11 PST 2004
#    Forked this script from the old visit script, which has now
#    become the new file "legacylauncher".  This one contains things
#    which are version-specific.  It is somewhat modified from the
#    original visit script: it has the version argument parsing
#    removed, it no longer can parse tools by their arguments
#    (e.g. "-silex"), it pulls some important things (VISITVERSION,
#    VISITPROGRAM, VISITDIR) from environment variables assuming that
#    they came set by the frontendlauncher, I removed the old
#    backwards-compatibility hacks, and made it assume executable
#    programs are in a top-level 'exe' directory for development
#    versions (e.g. running in the VOB).  I removed any assumptions
#    about the splashscreen being a separate program as well.....
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Dec  9 16:51:55 PST 2004
#    Also, added support for more than one available architecture for
#    any platform -- e.g. try 64-bit and fall back to 32- if that
#    fails.  Coincidentally, also added support for 64-bit objects on
#    IBM.  It keys off the OBJECT_MODE environment variable which is
#    standard on AIX, apparently, for their entire build toolchain.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Dec 13 13:36:23 PST 2004
#    Made it look for makemovie.py in its actual location instead of
#    assuming it was an executable.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Feb 17 15:29:20 PST 2005
#    Added support for valgrind.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Feb 22 18:57:58 PST 2005
#    Renamed convert to visitconvert because it is more unique.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sun Mar  6 08:56:30 PST 2005
#    Added -allowdynamic to fullhelp listing.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Mar 28 10:00:15 PST 2005
#    Added more timings options to -fullhelp.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Apr  1 16:05:49 PST 2005
#    Added valgrind to -fullhelp, and unlimited the errors it will report.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Apr 28 18:02:28 PDT 2005
#    Added multi-compiler support.  Added linux-intel-icc platform.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon May 9 11:45:21 PDT 2005
#    Added support for -newconsole. I split the makemovie.py script and
#    made this program call makemoviemain.py.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul  6 14:46:56 PDT 2005
#    Added xlc compiler-specific support.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 21 11:13:46 PDT 2005
#    Q underwent a major upgrade, so the hardcoded paths changed.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Jul 25 11:58:46 PDT 2005
#    Fixed problem with -newconsole on AIX.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Aug  3 10:21:31 PDT 2005
#    Added -stereo to the help text.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Aug 24 16:48:02 PDT 2005
#    Added text to -config for absolute paths.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Aug 30 10:00:17 PDT 2005
#    Keep track of original environment variables like library paths and
#    plugin dirs explicitly.  In some cases, the engine may try to set them
#    differently from the other components, and the existing logic would fail.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep 15 16:34:15 PDT 2005
#    Added ability to launch visit script under mpirun in order to set up
#    the environment on beowulf clusters (and similar).  Added -machinefile
#    for the same enviroment under mpich.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep 27 16:49:03 PDT 2005
#    Added -machinefile to options for engineargs.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep 29 11:11:35 PDT 2005
#    Made the "-setupenv" flag force the full path name to the visit script.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Oct 28 11:17:28 PDT 2005
#    Added AWE fix for -newconsole under AIX.
#
#    Kathlene Bonnell, Wed Nov  9 16:23:19 PST 2005
#    Added qsub launch command.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Tue Nov 22 09:42:57 PST 2005
#    Removed refs to sl_io subdirectory
#
#    Hank Childs, Sat Dec  3 20:47:45 PST 2005
#    Add support for hardware acceleration.  Also allow for processors to
#    be specified without nodes being specified (ie -nn without -ln) with
#    psub, which is tricky because syntax changes in this case.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Jan 11 17:46:19 PST 2006
#    Added help for -nowindowmetrics.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Aug 28 17:23:42 EDT 2006
#    When launching the engine, choose the serial one if the number of
#    processors is 1.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Nov 17 16:01:04 PST 2006
#    Added support for multiple switch types.  Added linux-x86_64-ib platform.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Tue Nov 21 16:30:17 PST 2006
#    Prevent -compiler flag from being passed on to most programs since
#    they either can't deal with it or don't need it because they don't
#    start other VisIt components. Added -viewer_geometry, -window_anchor.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Tue Nov 28 15:06:42 PST 2006
#    Added support for the psub/mpirun launch method.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Wed Nov 29 12:54:32 PST 2006
#    Modified the psub arguments to pass both -np and -g to indicate the
#    number of processors.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jan 17 15:53:46 EST 2007
#    Made GDB only set paths to the main program source directory
#    for the executable being launched.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Thu Feb 15 12:35:04 PST 2007
#    Added support for passing additional sublauncher arguments.  Enhanced
#    the qsub launch method to support qsub/mpiexec and qsub/srun.  Corrected
#    several qsub errors.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Mar 16 14:16:00 EDT 2007
#    Clear the PYTHONHOME environment variable if exe_name is "engine_par".
#    MPICH-2, for example, has a python-based launcher, and setting this
#    unconditionally will prevent parallel engines from launching.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Wed Apr  4 10:07:51 PDT 2007
#    Added support for specifying 32 or 64 bit executables for aix.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Wed Apr  4 18:02:52 PDT 2007
#    Treat the platformDir like all of the others, allowing darwin-ppc,
#    darwin-i386, [or darwin (universal) directory].
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Apr  6 13:54:55 PDT 2007
#    Modified the script to not dump core files if running a parallel
#    engine using either psub or qsub.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Tue Apr 10 11:46:50 PDT 2007
#    Replacing "uname -m" with "uname -p" for darwin.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Wed May 23 17:04:07 PDT 2007
#    FreeBSD patches from Nathan Lay <nlay@scs.fsu.edu>
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jun  6 12:42:27 EDT 2007
#    Added documentation of -outputtoinputdir flag for xml tools.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jun  6 16:45:55 EDT 2007
#    Added documentation of -forceinteractivecli flag for CLI interpreter.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Thu Jun 14 10:26:37 PDT 2007
#    Added documentation for -cycleregex
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jun 28 13:27:34 EDT 2007
#    Understand the -sshtunneling argument to prevent -guesshost from
#    overriding the correct host name and to set a default value of
#    localhost when no host name was specified.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jul 17 16:36:07 EDT 2007
#    Added -fullscreen argument to help text.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Wed Jul 18 13:29:32 PDT 2007
#    Made a number of miscellaneous enhancements to the qsub launch method
#    including getting it to also work with msub (they have the same syntax
#    for what we are using), adding support for mpirun as a sublauncher,
#    adding support for banks, improving the support for time limits, and
#    fixing a couple of bugs.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Thu Jul 19 17:12:33 PDT 2007
#    Added -strace option. Also, adding this comment to indicate that
#    'visit -diff <dbl> <dbr>' capability was added since June 28th, 2007
#    modification comment.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Aug  8 14:34:50 PDT 2007 
#    For redrose at sandia, parse the launchargs for '-l vis', in order
#    to add it correctly to the qsub args. 
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Thu Aug  9 10:40:04 PDT 2007 
#    For redrose at sandia, added HACK to set the correct LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
#    in case user's loaded modules don't match what VisIt was built with. 
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Aug 29 17:14:57 PDT 2007
#    For non-Darwin, when the "-newconsole" command starts an xterm, have
#    it call the VisIt script, not the program directly.  This is because some 
#    "xterm" programs have the sticky bit set for the group.  If the
#    sticky bit is set, then the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset to prevent a Trojan
#    horse attack ... meaning that the program wouldn't be able to run,
#    since it depends on a valid LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  So, always have the xterm 
#    call the VisIt script, which can then set up the environment again.
#
#    Thomas R. Treadway, Tue Sep 11 12:38:17 PDT 2007
#    Changed DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH, because
#    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH overrides the system libraries causing the wrong
#    libraries to be loaded.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Thu Nov 15 21:44:19 PST 2007
#    Modified the way args to tools such as valgrind and totalview are
#    processed. Before the user had to place all args to be passed to
#    the tools in a single quoted string. Now, all args that appear between
#    the tool's name and the name of the VisIt component it is to be
#    launched on are treated as args to the tool. No special quoting is
#    necessary.
#
#    Hank Childs, Fri Dec  7 09:14:57 PST 2007
#    Added -info-dump to -fullhelp message.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Dec 10 14:05:43 PST 2007
#    Added -protocol to the -fullhelp message.
#
#    Dave Pugmire, Tue Dec 11 08:15:16 EST 2007
#    For qsub, pass the environment variables on the command line via
#    the -v option. Also, for qsub/mpirun, set the -plugindir argument
#    to engine_par as some installations don't pass the env vars to the
#    executable.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Dec 13 13:23:20 EST 2007
#    Moved version parsing code to frontendlauncher.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Dec 14 15:33:57 EST 2007
#    Added documentation for -forceversion option.
#
#    Dave Pugmire, Mon Dec 17 12:42:34 EST 2007
#    Add qsub/aprun launch option.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Dec 20 17:19:56 PST 2007
#    Added -debug-malloc for the Mac.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Thu Jan 17 13:42:58 PST 2008
#    Removed the extra spaces between the comma seperated list of
#    variable=value pairs that get passed to the -v option for qsub or msub.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Mon Jan 28 16:38:48 PST 2008
#    Removed Gig-E hack for tidalwave, white and edgewater. Added
#    management of PYTHONPATH to support specifying where PIL is for testing. 
#
#    Dave Pugmire, Mon Feb  4 12:19:22 EST 2008
#    Added jaguarcnl.ornl.gov specific code.
#
#    Dave Pugmire, Thu Feb  7 07:45:46 EST 2008
#    Fixed the addtion of jaguarcnl.ornl.gov specific code for macs.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Feb 11 15:01:24 EST 2008
#    Components directory was renamed to avt.
#
#    Cyrus Harrison, Wed Feb 13 14:24:35 PST 2008
#    Added info about optional output directory argument for -dump and 
#    -info-dump
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Feb 14 13:00:03 EST 2008
#    Added the -viewerdisplay <dpy> argument.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sat Feb 23 09:57:21 PST 2008
#    Feed arguments into MOAB in a way that it will accept.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Mar 19 14:19:32 EDT 2008
#    Added code to obsolete -default_format.  This can be removed in future
#    versions.  Replaced it with -fallback_format.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Thu Mar 20 13:52:30 EDT 2008
#    Unset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Darwin so that we can't be hit by anything the
#    user might have set.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Thu Apr  3 14:54:42 PDT 2008
#    Added comments regarding -debug_<compname> and -vtk-debug arguments.
#
#    Gunther H. Weber, Tue Apr  8 17:32:24 PDT 2008
#    Added franklin.nersc.gov specific code
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Wed Apr  9 14:17:18 PDT 2008
#    Added -locale option.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Apr 11 11:42:26 PDT 2008
#    Added a hack to use the moab ttc option to specify the number of
#    processors if running on yana.
#
#    Dave Bremer, Wed Apr 16 17:54:14 PDT 2008
#    Added hooks for commands to run pre and post the mpi command,
#    and added a flag to qsub to indicate num procs per node.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Apr 30 13:12:13 EDT 2008
#    Added loopback support: it replaces the remote host name with 127.0.0.1
#    unless the "-noloopback" flag is given by visit or by the user.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon May 12 14:47:11 EDT 2008
#    Added lens.ccs.ornl.gov specific code.
# 
#    Sean Ahern, Mon May 12 14:47:11 EDT 2008
#    Put back use_vis logic that got accidentally blown away.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jun 12 14:52:56 EDT 2008
#    Need to check for parallel arguments here to disable loopback.
#    Previously I was checking when adding profile arguments inside
#    the proxy code, but you can add parallel arguments either on
#    the command line, or through the CLI, without going through that
#    code.  So the only truly safe place to check is here.
#
#    Gunther H. Weber, Tue Jul  1 11:03:51 PDT 2008
#    Added -pluginpath option when launching via mpirun since not all
#    mpi variants will propagate environment variables.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Mon Jul 21 10:54:22 EDT 2008
#    I added a warning to IsAVisItComponent which is triggered if the user
#    enters `engine' but screws up (or forgets) the suffix.
#    I abstracted valgrind settings out to a method, and made launching a
#    parallel engine under valgrind work for the straight `mpirun' case.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Jul 22 16:02:22 EDT 2008
#    Added help output for `-icet' flag.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Thu Jul 24 14:53:49 EDT 2008
#    Remove unused arguments from generate_args_valgrind; they weren't passed
#    as references and wouldn't be interpreted correctly anyway.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Wed Jul 30 11:46:45 EDT 2008
#    Made the check for X11-based terminals in darwin a bit more robust.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Mon Aug  4 10:54:52 EDT 2008
#    Changed how we run perl.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Aug 11 10:33:40 PDT 2008
#    I modified the script to make sure that it doesn't add any leading ":",
#    trailing ":", or imbedded "::" strings to any paths, since this adds
#    "." to the search path, which is insecure and can cause tough to
#    diagnose problems.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Wed Aug 13 09:43:07 PDT 2008
#    Added a hack to use the moab ttc option to specify the number of
#    processors if running on hopi.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Aug 18 10:32:47 PDT 2008
#    I added support for just "msub" as a parallel launch method.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Fri Aug 15 17:31:35 EDT 2008
#    Added valgrind support to the qsub/mpirun launch method.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Fri Aug 15 17:31:35 EDT 2008
#    Made the function which creates valgrind arguments set an environment
#    variable which helps prevent false positive.
#
#    Sean Ahern (via Tom Fogal), Fri Aug 22 16:08:37 EDT 2008
#    Fixed up the hack included for ORNL's `Lens' cluster, which likes to load
#    PGI-based libraries behind the user's back.
#    Default to use `sh' in qsub scripts; it's more portable than tcsh.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Sat Aug 23 14:45:04 EDT 2008
#    Removed all force specification's of the xterm's font, allowing the user's
#    X resource DB to take effect.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Aug 26 14:02:15 EDT 2008
#    Fixed a couple minor errors with the recent qsub changes.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Aug 27 08:38:49 PDT 2008
#    Change ncpus to ppn.  This takes out compatibility with cosmea, but
#    it is a safe thing to do on the RC and I'll fix up cosmea manually.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Oct 10 16:25:17 PDT 2008
#    Removed support for the switch type.
#
#    Gunther H. Weber, Wed Oct 15 11:42:55 PDT 2008
#    Improved detection of whether script is running on franklin.nersc.gov
#    If Running on franklin.nersc.gov look for plugins in /scratch instead
#    of user's home since an engine running on compute nodes does not have
#    access to a user's home directory.
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Oct 14 12:36:16 MDT 2008
#    Fixed the fullhelp for parallel hardware acceleration.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Thu Oct 16 11:02:12 PDT 2008
#    Fixed processing of args to debug tools like totalview, valgrind, strace
#    and debug_malloc. These looped over command line args until the hit a 
#    VisIt component name. However, if they never hit a VisIt component name,
#    things could fail in obscure and hard to understand ways. Now, they print
#    an error message and exit. Also, fixed totalview invokation for mpirun'd
#    parallel engines.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Fri Oct 17 08:54:45 PDT 2008
#    Fixed documentation for cycleregex which had a non-backslashed '$'
#    character causing the process number to be inserted in the fullhelp string
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Nov  5 15:48:09 PST 2008
#    Add support for Eureka at Argonne.  Note that this sets up an environment
#    variable (PYTHONPATH) that is likely to change.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Dec  3 10:39:44 PST 2008
#    Add -sshtunneling to the "-fullhelp" message.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Dec  3 15:52:00 EST 2008
#    Added a little warning to -sshtunneling.
#
#    Dave Pugmire, Thu Jan 15 16:43:07 EST 2009
#    Add -debug_engine_rank option.
#
#    Gunther H. Weber, Mon Feb  2 18:05:13 PST 2009
#    Set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH on franklin expicitly to include the path to the
#    gcc version used to build VisIt so that users with different loaded modules
#    still have a path to the correct C++ standard libraries. Use copy of env
#    in VisIt directory since using the system version breaks some NERSC job
#    validation scripts.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Feb  4 15:40:22 CST 2009
#    Remove PYTHONPATH logic for Argonne's Eureka machine.  No longer needed.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Feb 11 15:03:18 EST 2009
#    Confirmed PYTHONPATH isn't needed for Eureka and deleted the line.
#    Added remote host fix for parallel launches; the remote nodes think
#    it's called login1-mgmt.  (It used to be hard-coded in the ANL config
#    host profiles, but that prevented client-server from working.)
#
#    Hank Childs, Fri Feb 13 12:27:28 CST 2009
#    Merge in changes from RC, which includes new support for now unset
#    env var for Myrinet libs.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Wed Mar  4 18:02:40 PST 2009
#    Added logic to run _lite versions of convert tool.
#
#    Patrick Shinpaugh, Wed Mar 11 11:39:36 MST 2009
#    Add ppc64 to the launcher types we support / know of.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, Mon Mar 30 17:55:08 PDT 2009
#    Added cli to list of component names in IsAVisItComponentName
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Apr 22 17:43:26 PDT 2009
#    Added environemnt variable VISITULTRAHOME, so that VisIt knows where to 
#    find the ultra wrapper.
#
#    Kathleen Bonnell, Wed Apr 22 17:43:26 PDT 2009
#    Added environemnt variable VISITULTRAHOME, so that VisIt knows where to 
#    find the ultra wrapper.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sat Apr 25 11:35:31 CDT 2009
#    (1) Undo Perl magic that Sean put in about a year ago.  It seemed like a
#    more elegant solution, but it was biting LLNL and TACC and Perl experts
#    were not able to figure it out.  (2) Add support for TACC.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sun Apr 26 21:18:36 CDT 2009
#    Add support for Argonne machine "gadzooks", which has a weird connection

    Interface options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -gui                 Run with the Graphical User Interface (default).
        -cli                 Run with the Command Line Interface.

    Movie making options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -movie               Run the CLI in a movie making mode. Must be
                             combined with -sessionfile. Will produce a simple
                             movie by drawing all the plots in the specified
                             session for every timestep of the database.

    Startup options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -o <filename>        Open the specified data file at startup.
        -s <filename>        Run the specified VisIt script. Note: This
                             argument only takes effect with -cli or -movie.
        -sessionfile <filename>  Open the specified session file at startup
                             Note that this argument only takes effect with
                             -gui or -movie.
        -config <filename>   Initialize the viewer at startup using the named
                             config file.  If an absolute path is not given,
                             the file is assumed to be in the .visit directory.
        -noconfig            Don't process configuration files at startup.
        -launchengine <host> Launch an engine at startup. The <host> parameter
                             is optional. If it is not specified, the engine
                             will be launched on the local host. If you wish
                             to launch an engine on a remote host, specify 
                             the host's name as the <host> parameter.
        -nosplash            Do not display the splash screen at startup.

    Window options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -small               Use a smaller desktop area/window size.
        -geometry <spec>     What portion of the screen to use.  This is a
                             standard X Windows geometry specification. This
                             option can be used to set the size of images
                             generated from scripts and movies.

        -viewer_geometry <spec> What portion of the screen the viewer windows
                                will use. This is a standard X Windows geometry
                                specification. This option overrides the
                                -geometry option that the GUI passes to the
                                viewer.

        -window_anchor <x,y> The x,y position on the screen where VisIt's GUI
                             will show its windows (Main window excluded).
        -style <style>       One of: windows,cde,motif,sgi.
        -locale <locale>     The locale that you want VisIt to use when displaying
                             translated menus and controls. VisIt will use the
                             default locale if the -locale option is not
                             provided.
        -background <color>  Background color for GUI.
        -foreground <color>  Foreground color for GUI.
        -nowin               Run with viewer windows off-screen (i.e. OSMesa).
                             This is typically used with the -cli option.
        -stereo              Enable active stereo, also known as the
                             page-flipping, or 'CrystalEyes' mode.
        -nowindowmetrics     Prevents X11 from grabbing and moving a test
                             widget used in calculating window borders. This
                             option can be useful if VisIt hangs when 
                             displaying to an Apple X-server.

    Version options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -version             Do NOT run VisIt. Just print the current version.
        -svn_revision        Do NOT run VisIt. Just print the Subversion 
                             revision it was built from.
        -beta                Run the current beta version.
        -v <version>         Run a specified version (e.g. '1.3.3').

                              ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
    ***************************************************************************

    Parallel launch options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Notes: All of these options are ordinarily obtained from host profiles.
        However, the command line options override anything in the profiles. 

        When parallel arguments are added but the engine is not the
        component being launched, -launchengine is implied.  Explicitly
        add -launchengine to launch a remote parallel engine.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -setupenv            Use the VisIt script to set up the environment
                             for the engine on the compute nodes.
        -par                 Run the parallel version. This option is implied
                             by any of the other parallel options listed below.
        -l    <method>       Launch in parallel using the given method.
        -pl   <method>       Launch only the engine in parallel as specified.
        -la   <args>         Additional arguments for the parallel launcher.
        -sla  <args>         Additional arguments for the parallel sublauncher.
        -np   <# procs>      The number of processors to use.
        -nn   <# nodes>      The number of nodes to allocate.
        -p    <part>         Partition to run in.
        -n    <name>         The parallel job name.
        -b    <bank>         Bank from which to draw resources.
        -t    <time>         Maximum job run time.
        -machinefile <file>  Machine file.
        -expedite            Makes DPCS give priority scheduling.

        -icet                In scalable rendering mode, use the IceT parallel
                             image compositor.

    Hardware accelerated parallel (scalable) rendering options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Notes: These options should only be used with parallel clusters that
        have graphics cards.  If you are using a serial version of VisIt, you
        are already getting hardware acceleration and these options are not 
        needed.  Furthermore, you must be in scalable rendering mode for VisIt
        to utilize a cluster's GPUs.  By default, VisIt is configured to
        switch into scalable rendering mode when rendering complexity exceeds
        a predefined limit.

        VisIt must manage the creation and teardown of X servers when the
        number of GPUs per node exceeds one.  It will do this automatically,
        though you may customize the procedure with the -x-args parameter.

        See the VisIt wiki for more information:

          http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Parallel_Hardware_Acceleration

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -hw-accel              Tells VisIt that it should use graphics cards.
        -n-gpus-per-node <int> Number of GPUs per node of the cluster (1).
        -x-args '<string>'     Extra arguments to X server.

    Load balance options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Note: Each time VisIt executes a pipeline the relevant domains for the
        execution are assigned to processors. This list of domains is sorted in
        increasing global domain number. The options below effect how domains
        in this list are assigned to processors. Assuming there are D domains
        and P processors...
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -lb-block            Assign the first D/P domains to processor 0, the
                             next D/P domains to processor 1, etc.
        -lb-stride           Assign every Pth domain starting from the first
                             to processor 0, every Pth domain starting from the
                             second to processor 1, etc.
        -lb-absolute         Assign domains by absolute domain number % P. This
                             guarentees a given domain is always processed
                             by the same processor but can also lead to poor
                             balance when only a subset of domains is selected.
        -lb-random           Randomly assign domains to processors.
        -allowdynamic        Dedicate one processor to spreading the work 
                             dynamically among the other processors.  This mode
                             has limitations in the types of queries it can 
                             perform.  Under development.
        -lb-stream           Similar to -lb-block, but have the domains travel
                             down the pipeline one at a time, instead of all
                             together.  Under development.

    Database differencing options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Use the '-diff <ldb> <rdb>' option to run VisIt in a database
        differencing mode. VisIt will generate expressions to facilitate
        visualization and analysis of the difference between the left-database,
        <ldb>, and right-database, <rdb>. VisIt will open windows to display
        both the left and right databases as well as their difference.

        VisIt uses the Cross-Mesh Field Evaluation (CMFE) expression functions
        to help generate these differences. A CMFE function creates an instance
        of a variable from another (source) mesh on the specified (destination)
        mesh. VisIt can use two variants of CMFE expression functions depending
        on how similar the source and destination meshes are; connectivity-based
        (conn_cmfe) which assumes the underlying mesh(s) for the left and right
        databases have identical connectivity and position-based (pos_cmfe) which
        does not make this assumption. VisIt will attempt to automatically select
        which variant of CMFE expression to use based on some simple heuristics.
        For meshes with identical connectivity, conn_cmfe expressions are
        preferrable because they are higher performance and do not require VisIt
        to perform any interpolation. In fact, the conn_cmfe operation is
        perfectly anti-symmetric. That is <ldb> - <rdb> = -(<rdb> - <ldb>).
        The same cannot be said for pos_cmfe expressions. However, pos_cmfe
        expressions will attempt to generate useful results regardless of the
        similarity of the underlying meshes.

        Note that the differences VisIt will compute in this mode are single
        precision. This is true regardless of whether the input data is itself
        double precision. VisIt will convert double precision to single 
        precision before processing it. Although this is a result of earlier
        visualization-specific design requirements and constraints, the intention
        is that eventually double precision will be supported.

        Finally, be sure to bring up Controls->Macros in the GUI to find a set
        of useful operations specifically tailored to database differencing. Also,
        typing 'help()' (including the '()') at the python prompt after starting
        'visit -diff' will generate a more detailed help message.

        -diff <ldb> <rdb>    Indicate you wish to run VisIt in database
                             differencing mode and specify the two databases
                             to difference.

                             Note: All options occuring on the command-line
                             *after* the '-diff' option are treated as options
                             to the differencing script while all options
                             occuring *before* the '-diff' option are treated
                             as options to VisIt.

        -diffsum <ldb> <rdb> Run only the DiffSummary() method of the
                             'visit -diff' script, in nowin mode so its fast,
                             print the results, and immediatly exit.

        -force_pos_cmfe      Force use of position-based CMFE expressions.

    Advanced options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -guesshost           Try to guess the client host name from one of
                             the SSH_CLIENT, SSH2_CLIENT, or SSH_CONNECTION
                             environment variables.
        -noloopback          Disable use of the 127.0.0.1 loopback device.
        -sshtunneling        Tunnel all remote connections through ssh.  NOTE:
                             this overrides values set in the host profiles.
        -noint               Disable interruption capability.
        -nopty               Run without PTYs.
        -verbose             Prints status information during pipeline
                             execution.
        -fallback_format     Sets the database plugin format to use as a
                             fallback if a file type cannot be determined
                             from its extension.
        -assume_format       Sets the database plugin format to try before
                             all others when attempting to guess the format.
        -dir <directory>     Run a version of VisIt in the specified directory.
                             The directory argument should specify the 
                             path to a visit installation directory.
                             /bin is automatically appended to this path.
        -forceversion <ver>  Force the given version.  Overrides all
                             intelligent version selection logic.
        -publicpluginsonly   Disable all plugins but the default ones.
        -compiler <cc>       Require version built with the specified compiler.
        -objectmode <mode>   Require a specific object file mode.
        -forceinteractivecli Force the CLI to behave interactively, even if run
                             with no terminal; similar to python's '-i' flag.
        -fullscreen          Create the viewer window in full screen mode.
                             May not be compatible with all window managers.
        -viewerdisplay <dpy> Have the viewer use a different display than the
                             current value of DISPLAY.  Can be useful for
                             powerwall displays with a separate console.
        -cycleregex <string> A regex-style regular expression to be used
                             in extracting cycle numbers from file names. It
                             is best to bracket this string in single
                             quotes (') to avoid shell interpretation of
                             special characters such as star (*). The format
                             of the string begins with an opening '<' character,
                             followed by the regular expression itself followed
                             by a closing '>' character, optionally followed by
                             a space ' ' character and sub-expression reference
                             to indicate which part of the regular expression is
                             the cycle number.  Default behavior is as if
                             -cycleregex '<([0-9]+)[^0-9]*\$> \\0'
                             was specified meaning the last sequence of one
                             or more digits before the end of the string found
                             is used as the cycle number. Do a 'man 7 regex'
                             to get more information on regular expression
                             syntax.
        -ui-bcast-thresholds <int1> <int2> 
                             Two integers controlling behavior of parallel
                             engine waiting in a broadcast for the next RPC
                             from the viewer. VisIt used to rely solely upon
                             MPI_Bcast for this. However, many implementations
                             of MPI_Bcast use a polling loop that winds up
                             keeping all processors busy and can make them
                             unuseable by other processes. This is particulary
                             bad for SMPs. So, VisIt implemented its own
                             broadcast using MPI's send/recv methods. <int1>
                             specifies the number of nano-seconds a processor
                             sleeps while polling for completion of the
                             broadcast. Specifying a value of zero (0) for <int1>
                             results in falling back to older behavior using
                             MPI's MPI_Bcast. <int1> effectively controls how
                             'busy' processors will be, polling for completion
                             of the broadcast. <int2> specifies the number of
                             seconds all processors should spin, polling as fast
                             as possible, checking for completion of the
                             broadcast BEFORE inserting sleeps into their

                             many seconds VisIt's server will be maximally
                             responsive (although also keeping all processors
                             occupied) before becoming more 'friendly' to
                             other processes on the same node. The defaults
                             are <int1> = 50000000 nanoseconds (1/20th of a sec)
                             and <int2> = 5 seconds meaning VisIt will spin
                             processors maximally for 5 seconds before inserting
                             sleeps such that polling happens at the rate of 20
                             times per second.

    Debugging options
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Note: Debugging options may degrade performance 
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -debug <level>       Run with <level> levels of output logging.
                             <level> must be between 1 and 5. This will generate
                             debug logs (called 'vlogs' for ALL components.
                             Note that debug logs are UNbuffered. However, if
                             you also specify 'b' immediately after the digit
                             indicating the debug level (e.g. '-debug 3b'), the
                             logs will be buffered. This can substantially improve
                             performance when a lot of debug output is generated.
                             However, also beware that when debug logs are buffered,
                             there isn't necessarily any guarentee they will contain
                             the most recent debug output just prior to a crash.
        -debug_<compname> <level>
                             Run specified component with <level> of output
                             logging. For example, '-debug_mdserver 4' will run
                             the mdserver with level 4 debugging. Multiple
                             '-debug_<compname> <level>' args are allowed.
        -debug_engine_rank <r>
                             Restrict debug output to the specified rank.
        -clobber_vlogs       By default, VisIt maintains debug logs from the 5
                             most recent invokations or restarts of each VisIt
                             component. They are named something like
                             A.mdserver.5.vlog, A.engine_ser.5.vlog, etc with
                             the leading letter (A-E) indicating most to least
                             recent. The clobber_vlogs flag causes VisIt to remove
                             all debug logs and begin creating them anew.
        -vtk-debug           Turn on debugging of vtk objects used in pipelines.
        -pid                 Append process ids to the names of log files.
        -timing              Save timing data to files.
        -withhold-timing-output
                             Withhold timing output during execution. Prevents
                             output of timing information from affecting
                             performance.
        -never-output-timings
                             Never output timings files.  This is used when
                             you want the timer to be enabled (for usage by
                             developers to measure inner loops), but you
                             want to avoid blowing memory with the bookkeeping
                             for each and every timing call.
        -timing-processor-stride N
                             Have only every Nth processor output timing info.
                             Prevents overwhelming parallel file systems.
        -env                 Print env. variables VisIt will use when run.
        -dump (dump_dir)     Dump intermediate results from AVT filters,
                             scalably rendered images, and html pages.
                             Takes an optional argument that specifies the 
                             directory for -dump output files.
        -info-dump (dump_dir) 
                             Dump html pages only. 
                             Takes an optional argument that specifies the 
                             directory for -info-dump output files.
        -gdb                 Run under gdb.
        -gdb-gui             Run the gui under gdb.
        -gdb-cli             Run the cli under gdb.
        -gdb-viewer          Run the viewer under gdb.
        -gdb-engine          Run the engine under gdb.
        -gdb-mdserver        Run the mdserver under gdb.
        -gdb-xmledit         Run xmledit under gdb.
        -break <funcname>    Add the specified breakpoint in gdb.
        -xterm               Run gdb in an xterm window.
        -newconsole          Run any VisIt component in a new console window.
        -totalview <args> <comp>
                             Run totalview with <args> on component <comp>.
                             Default <args> is whitespace.
        -valgrind <args> <comp>
                             Run valgrind with <args> on component <comp>.
                             Default <args> is --tool=memcheck --error-limit=no
                             --num-callers=64.
        -strace <args> <comp>
                             Run strace with <args> on component <comp>.
                             Default <args> is -ttt -T.

                             In the above, all arguments between the tool name
                             and the visit component name are treated as args
                             to the tool.

        -debug-malloc <args> <comp>
                             Run the component with the libMallocDebug library
                             on MacOS X systems. The libMallocDebug library
                             lets the MallocDebug application attach to the
                             instrumented application and retrieve memory
                             allocation statistics. The -debug-malloc flag
                             also sets up the environment for the leaks and
                             heap tools.

                             Printing heap allocations:
                             % visit -debug-malloc gui &
                             % Get the gui's <pid>
                             % heap <pid>

                             Printing memory leaks:
                             % visit -debug-malloc gui &
                             % Get the gui's <pid>
                             % leaks <pid>

                             Run with MallocDebug:
                             Perl does not seem to be happy with libMallocDebug
                             so you can run the GUI like this:
                             % visit -cli 
                             >>> OpenGUI('-debug-malloc', 'MallocDebug', 'gui')
                             Connect to the gui with MallocDebug and do your
                             sampling.

        -numrestarts <#>     Number of attempts to restart a failed engine.
        -quiet               Don't print the Running message.
        -protocol            Print the definitions of the state objects that
                             comprise the VisIt protocol so they can be compared
                             against the values on other computers.
