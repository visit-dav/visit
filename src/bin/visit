#         Run VisIt on various architectures
#
# Programmer:  Eric Brugger (adopted from a script by Jeremy Meredith and
#              Sean Ahern)
# Date      :  October 24, 2000
#
# Modifications:
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Feb 23 08:20:37 PST 2001
#    I added the setting of the environment variable MESA_GLX_FX to eliminate
#    a warning message on Linux when displaying to a remote display.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Mar 16 16:39:02 PST 2001
#    Added the -v option, the -beta option, and the -dir option.
#    No longer is the current version picked by a number, but simply by
#    a symlink called "current".
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Mar 28 13:53:05 PST 2001
#    Added directory for the current script to the path.  This means users
#    don't have to have this script in their path to run within-box.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Apr 20 10:38:47 PDT 2001
#    Pass versioning flags on to started process so we can then pass them
#    to remote processes.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Apr 27 15:27:09 PDT 2001
#    Made all text output go to stderr.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 10 15:20:08 PDT 2001
#    Added plugin directory.  Also made the current dir get added to the 
#    front of the path.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jun 25 21:40:30 PDT 2001
#    Changed binary names so the engine is called engine_ser or engine_par.
#    Made it accept the "-par" argument so that parallel options can be
#    added manually by the user.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jun 29 15:29:18 PDT 2001
#    Added other LD_LIBRARY_PATH-like environment variables.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 16 13:35:29 PDT 2001
#    Reworked the script.  Arguments for parallel are now general, not
#    specific to any launch method.  The launch method (poe/psub/mpirun etc.)
#    may also be explicity given, although a default is selected for each
#    machine.  The default for AIX is now poe, not psub.  Removed the 
#    calculation of nodes based on processors since it varies too widely
#    for each platform.  Added basic support for a python based CLI.
#    Rewrote the usage message.  Other cleaning as well.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 23 00:50:26 PDT 2001
#    Fixed some stuff....  Made better use of $variable_set flags.
#    Removed more unused stuff.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 23 12:15:55 PDT 2001
#    Fixed argument parsing.  It was stopping when an argument evaluated
#    to 0 instead of when it ran out of arguments.  Fixed help text as well.
#    Removed /usr/lib from the library search paths....  It was messing
#    up parallel AIX when it was included in LIBPATH, and since we weren't
#    sure it was needed at all, I removed it from all of them.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 23 16:53:49 PDT 2001
#    Added -small option.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jul 24 12:21:42 PDT 2001
#    Added checks so we don't modify LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH (etc.) unless
#    they already exist.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Sep  4 17:46:42 PDT 2001
#    Removed printing of the splashscreen launch command.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Sep 10 18:30:33 PDT 2001
#    Added the "-norun" option to merely print the command it will use
#    to run, then exit nicely.  Multiple -norun options may be specified
#    any they should all be honored.  Note that one must specify either
#    'engine_ser' or 'engine_par', not just 'engine'.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Sep 14 16:32:03 PST 2001
#    Added flags that are useful for scripting.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Apr 11 11:01:22 PDT 2002
#    Added a test for the mdserver's existence in addition to the given one.
#    This makes more things work on machines where we cannot build the GUI.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Apr 16 11:41:12 PDT 2002
#    Added a few arguments to the help text.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jun 14 10:46:44 PDT 2002
#    Added line to set LIBPATH inside the psub script since LoadLever does
#    not pass it, even when PSUB is given the -x flag.  Removed the setting
#    of the display since that should be passed with the -x option, and we
#    shouldn't care about DISPLAY for the engine anyway.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jun 17 15:17:55 PDT 2002
#    Split linux into linux-intel and linux-alpha.  I did not split into
#    different vendors/kernel versions yet, but this can be done if needed.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jul  5 17:43:24 PDT 2002
#    Made it create a home ~/.visit directory to store user settings,
#    plugins, etc.  Made it append your home .visit/ARCH/plugins directory
#    to the VISITPLUGINDIR environment variable.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Tue Jul  9 17:40:47 PDT 2002
#    Made it avoid duplicates for the plugin search paths, and reversed
#    the order so private ones will override public ones.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Jul 10 13:01:10 PDT 2002
#    Made the failure-to-launch messages a little smarter.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 15 01:09:12 PDT 2002
#    Made it set up a lot more things for generating makefiles for plugins.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Jul 15 09:58:49 PDT 2002
#    I made VISITHELPHOME point to the right place.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 18 12:27:26 PDT 2002
#    Added the -publicpluginsonly flag.  Added code to parse the version.
#    Added a check for versions prior to 0.9.12 to set the publiconly flag.
#    This check should be removed shortly after version 1.0.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul 22 12:35:54 PDT 2002
#    Added silex.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Sat Aug  3 11:47:58 PDT 2002
#    Added all XML tools.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Aug 16 10:59:59 PDT 2002
#    Added the new xml2java XML tool.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Aug 26 15:20:39 PDT 2002
#    Removed support for -dir flag.  Intentionally left in help message for
#    -dir, since that may be used to determine what flags to put in the GUI.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Sep 18 15:43:24 PDT 2002
#    Fixed a prun bug.  It should use "-n", not "-np", for the number of procs.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Sep 20 09:27:31 PDT 2002
#    Added private database plugin support.
#    Added better support for sh/ksh users for psub.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Oct 17 16:05:27 PDT 2002
#    Added XMLEdit, and put all xml tools into the help.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Tue Dec  3 09:54:55 PST 2002
#    Added -dump flag.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Dec 16 14:01:54 PST 2002
#    Added -verbose flag.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Dec 19 12:08:08 PST 2002
#    Added support code for launching engines from the command line.
#
#    Hank Childs, Sun Dec 29 14:47:05 PST 2002
#    Added -text2polys flag.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Jan  6 07:50:37 PST 2003
#    Added -time_annotation flag.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jan 2 12:43:25 PDT 2003
#    I added code to remove the -key argument from the printed arguments. I
#    also added support for debugging VisIt components with GDB. I also added
#    an -expedite flag so that the engine can be edpedited under DPCS.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Fri Jan 24 14:43:44 PST 2003
#    Added the ability to add arguments to the parallel launcher.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Thu Mar  6 00:57:10 PST 2003
#    Added support for debugging VisIt components with totalview.
#
#    Sean Ahern, Wed Mar 19 00:32:29 America/Los_Angeles 2003
#    Fixed gdb paths.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Apr  9 12:52:53 PDT 2003
#    Made the list of plugin types be in exactly one spot.  This way things
#    like expression or query plugins will be easier to add.  Also improved
#    how home-directory .visit/* directories are created.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Sat Apr 12 13:43:21 PDT 2003
#    Added support for a "sub-launcher" using psub.  For example,
#    psub works in conjunction with prun/poe on Quadrics/IBM systems.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Apr 14 15:33:45 PDT 2003
#    Made -launchengine default to localhost.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Wed Apr 16 10:58:16 PDT 2003
#    Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH when submitting to batch.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 24 07:31:07 PDT 2003
#    I prevented -v from being passed on as an argument to the visit
#    components since they now pass their internal version to other
#    components when they are launched.
#
#    Mark C. Miller, 01May03
#    Added -numrestarts option to viewer
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu May 15 13:53:09 PST 2003
#    Added support for MacOS X (Darwin).
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Wed Apr  2 10:51:33 PST 2003
#    Added number of nodes to prun (needed by Q machine).
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon May 19 17:31:33 PDT 2003
#    Added hack to allow version-passing for versions prior to 1.1.4
#    but since 1.0.  This should be removed when the oldest previous
#    version anyone will want to run is 1.1.4.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Jun 19 13:22:25 PST 2003
#    I removed splashscreen coding.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jun 26 10:05:12 PDT 2003
#    Added support for LANL's Q machine:  I added a hack to update
#    the user's paths.  I allowed the VCL to be launched in parallel.
#    I Added a parallel launcher ("-pl") argument.  It is much
#    like "-l", except it will only be triggered when launching the
#    engine.  I made the number of processors to be passed to the
#    parallel launcher only when the number of processors was actually
#    set.  I added support for "bsub" as a launcher.
#
#    Akira Haddox, Tue Jul  1 12:56:14 PDT 2003
#    Added the makemili tool.
#
#    Hank Childs, Wed Jul  2 11:40:48 PDT 2003
#    Added the surfcomp tool.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul  3 15:10:36 PDT 2003
#    Added doc for "-nopty".  Made it stricter about when it will
#    allow non-private plugin installs.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Jul  7 12:46:08 PDT 2003
#    They changed the path of "bsub" on Q, breaking things for the Q port.
#    I updated the path for the Q stuff to match it.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jul 24 15:58:45 PDT 2003
#    I added the ability to translate a known remotehost into a different
#    IP address.  This allows us to use the DISCOM pipes back to White from Q.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Mon Jul 28 15:47:43 PST 2003
#    I added movie-making options.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Fri Aug  1 08:19:05 PDT 2003
#    I added back the splashscreen support so that the script would still
#    work with previous versions.
#
#    Eric Brugger, Mon Aug 25 16:47:04 PDT 2003
#    I corrected a bug in the logic that decided if the vcl should be
#    launched in the batch system.  The fix was actually made by Jeremy.
#
#    Hank Childs, Tue Sep  9 08:35:42 PDT 2003
#    Add 'convert' program.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Mon Sep 29 11:26:47 PDT 2003
#    Added help for the "-o" and "-launchengine" flags.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Fri Oct 3 12:59:49 PDT 2003
#    I made the -s argument become -scriptfile when -movie is specified.
#
#    Jeremy Meredith, Thu Oct  9 13:12:51 PDT 2003
#    Added ability to guess remote client host name from SSH_CLIENT,
#    SSH2_CLIENT, or SSH_CONNECTION environment variables.
#    Added ia64 linux machine type.
#
#    Brad Whitlock, Thu Aug 21 14:34:42 PST 2003
#    Added support for MacOS X.
