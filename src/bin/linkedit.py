# Purpose:
#    This script is part of the coding to automatically determine segment
#    offsets for dynamic libraries on MacOS X so we can have prebound
#    libraries so VisIt launches faster.
#
# Notes:
#    When this program is called with the -readlines argument, we print the
#    segment offset. Otherwise, we read in the link edit file and compute the
#    next segment offset.
