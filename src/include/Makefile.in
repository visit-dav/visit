#   I replaced QTDIR with QT_INCLUDE.

#   Made the 'clean' target not remove things needed to correctly
#   generate dependencies.  That's now reserved for distclean.
#   In this case, it means removing the symlinks only in 'distclean'.
#
#   Jeremy Meredith, Thu Sep  6 16:53:41 EDT 2007
#   Don't forget to remove the Makefile in distclean.

#   Modified vtk include dir due to migration to a make installed vtk.
