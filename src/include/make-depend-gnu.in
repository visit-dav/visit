## Automatic dependencies...  We keep a list of dependencies in `.depend'
## for each of the source files on which it depends.  When one of the source
## files is modified we remove its record from .depend and regenerate the
## dependencies, tacking them onto the end of .depend.  By including the
## .depend file into the makefile, we're telling make that the makefile
## depends on the dependency list in the .depend file.
##
## This is as fast as the `.d' method described in the GNU make manual
## for automatic dependencies, but has the added advantage that all
## dependencies are stored in one place.  The advantage over the
## `makedepend' program is that only those files that are out of date
## have dependency information rebuilt, and the Makefile is not modified.

##    1) Made it work with .C, not .c files
##    2) Made it work correctly with subdirectories, e.g. "dir/file.C"

##    Made it work better in parallel.

##    Improve parallel dependencies.

##    Removed the test for subdirectores where it prepended the dirname.
##    It seems something has changed to render this unnecessary and
##    now it causes problems (specifically, dirname is now there twice).
##    Removing this section seems to fix the problem.
