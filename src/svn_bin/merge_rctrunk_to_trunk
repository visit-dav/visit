#    If the user is not in the trunk, then exit immediately.
#
#    Hank Childs, Mon Dec 17 14:25:38 PST 2007
#    See if there are checkouts before merging, force an SVN update before 
#    merging, and disallow changes to VERSION.
#
#    Hank Childs, Thu Dec 20 09:21:03 PST 2007
#    Renamed -allow_checkouts to -allow_local_mods
#
#    Tom Fogal, Tue Mar 17 21:55:56 MST 2009
#    Updated whence to which, to allow use on systems w/o ksh.
