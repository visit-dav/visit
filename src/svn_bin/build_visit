# *****************************************************************************
#   Script: build_visit
#
#   Purpose:
#       A script that performs a complete build of VisIt and its support
#       libraries.  The script will detect if support libraries have already
#       been built and, if so, use those pre-built libraries.
#
#   Warning:
#       This script is only expected to work for Linux, and Darwin systems.
#       If you need to build VisIt for another platform, you should consult
#       the BUILD_NOTES that come with the VisIt source.  That document
#       contains instructions on how to build VisIt and its third party
#       libraries.
#
#   This script has been tested and is known to work with the following OS/
#   compiler combinations:
#
#	OS	Hardware	Compiler	Machine
#	-----	--------	--------	-------
#       RHEL3,	x86,		GCC 3.4.6	staples.llnl.gov
#       RHEL3, 	x86,		GCC 3.2.3	hoth.llnl.gov
#       CHAOS, 	x86_64,		GCC 3.4.5	vertex.llnl.gov
#       CHAOS,	ia64, 		GCC 3.4.5	thunder.llnl.gov
#       SuSE,   x86_64,		GCC 4.0.2	antares.lbl.gov
#       SuSE,   x86_64,		GCC 4.1.0	octagon.lbl.gov
#       MacOSX  i386,		GCC 4.0.1	dantooine.llnl.gov
#       MacOSX  ppc,		GCC 4.0.1	snailbait.llnl.gov
#
#   It is believed that this script will also work with other Linux variations.
#   Please send feedback to visit-users@ornl.gov if you run into problems 
#   so that this script can be improved in the future.  If you have built
#   VisIt using this script on an OS/hardware/compiler combination not listed
#   above, please send a note to visit-users@ornl.gov, so we can add that
#   information to the script.
#
#   Setup:
#       This script assumes you have downloaded the VisIt source code and 
#       the necessary third party libraries and that they are placed in the
#       current directory.  If it does not locate these libraries, it will
#       try to download them.
#       You must have:
#          Qt		qt-x11-opensource-4.4.3.tar.gz
#                    or qt-mac-opensource-4.4.3.tar.gz (Mac)
#          Mesa         MesaLib-6.4.2.tar.gz
#                    or Mesa-5.0-mangled.tar.gz (Linux)
#          Python	Python-2.5.tgz
#          VTK		vtk-5.0.0c.tar.gz
#          CMake	cmake-2.4.5.tar.gz
#
#        The following optional libraries need to be in the current directory
#        to be built. You must explicitly select which option library to
#        build, either through run string options or the dialog gui. If
#        the tarballs don't exist they will not be built or downloaded
#           Library  Version  Source Tarball Name    Command Option

#
#     Hank Childs, Thu Sep 13 06:15:07 PDT 2007
#     If you are building Exodus, then build NetCDF too.  Otherwise the build

#     Make szip build on FC9.  (szip is required for HDF5.)
#
#     Hank Childs, Mon Sep  1 09:21:27 PDT 2008
#     Move all patches to their own function.  (Purpose is to improve
#     readability and maintainability.)
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Oct  2 22:03:56 MDT 2008
#     Move PIL out of build_python into its own function.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Fri Oct  3 11:01:28 MDT 2008
#     Fix the PIL download URL, and add a dir variable.
#     Added a set of functions for ease of use.
#     Cleaned up the PIL build function, and don't redirect the function so it
#     can easily use the new functions to log information.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Oct  6 23:11:17 MDT 2008
#     Force -fPIC in BoxLib for non-AIX.  Switch fortran to compiler to
#     `gfortran' if `g77' is not found.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Oct  9 16:11:56 MDT 2008
#     Long options and parsing.
#     Updated 'usage' message to account for long options, and greatly
#     improved the formatting.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Fri Oct 10 11:20:24 MDT 2008
#     Removed an embarassing oversight leftover from debugging my
#     earlier work on the PIL.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Tue Oct 14 11:23:14 PDT 2008
#     Changed the version to 1.11.0.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct 21 10:32:36 PDT 2008
#     Modified to support VisIt's configure new way of handling hdf5.
#     Modified to support shared hdf5.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Oct 22 09:05:43 MDT 2008
#     Add an --szip command line to enable SZip.  Don't force SZip if the user
#     wants HDF5, but enable SZip if they ask for it.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct 28 11:14:17 PDT 2008
#     Modified build of H5Part to use -DH5_USE_16_API. See notes in that func.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Mon Nov 17 22:30:28 PST 2008
#     Made Silo optional instead of required; removed Silo patching; upgraded
#     Silo version to 4.6.2. Copied the pattern used for CCMIO.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Nov 20 10:03:12 PST 2008
#     Fixed typo in DEFAULT_SILO symbols put in generated config-site file.
#     Updated DEFAULT_SILO symbols to use LIBLOC/LIBDEP form.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Nov 18 16:34:49 PST 2008
#     Changes for Qt4 including:
#      *Added build_qt4 (doesn't currently download the src tarball however)
#      *Replaced the repeated "check for dir + try to unzip + try to untar" 
#        chunk of code with new function: prepare_build_dir
#      *Changed all build dirs vars to name [NAME]_BUILD_DIR, instead of 
#        [NAME]_DIR.In some cases [NAME]_DIR caused problems and was previously 
#        fixed with a special name BV_[NAME]_DIR, I just made everything 
#        uniform.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Dec  2 13:44:29 PST 2008
#     Stopped creating symlink of szip static lib in hdf5 install.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sat Dec  6 21:27:55 PST 2008
#     A silo path variable was missing "silo".
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Dec  8 22:46:17 MST 2008
#     Quoted compiler flags given to VTK.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Dec 11 08:38:41 PST 2008
#     Made the auto-generated config-site file a little more portable by
#     creating a VISITARCH variable in the file and using \$VISITARCH
#     everywhere to refer to that variable in the config-site file and not
#     the shell variable defined in build_visit.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Thu Dec 11 16:02:54 EST 2008
#     Modified the variables in the auto-generated config-site file for
#     Silo-HDF5 dependency.
#
#     Hank Childs, Fri Dec 12 09:11:07 PST 2008
#     Added support for Ice-T.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Fri Dec 12 14:14:55 PST 2008
#     Fixed problem with checking if cgns is already built/installed.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Fri Dec 12 14:14:55 PST 2008
#     Changed version of google-perftools to 0.97 (from 0.98). 
#     0.97 is the version already in our repo and I verified it was the 
#     version Hank integrated into VisIt. 
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Dec 15 16:21:47 MST 2008
#     Cleanups for the IceT macro: handle multiple options in PAR_INCLUDE,
#     enable verbose makefiles so debugging IceT issues is possible, and
#     install IceT instead of copying libraries manually.
#
#     Hank Childs, Mon Jan 26 15:57:02 PST 2009
#     Add support for FastBit.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jan 29 13:24:34 EST 2009
#     Fixing Mesa 6.4.2 patching.  (This is already fixed on the 2.0 branch?)
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sat Feb  7 15:40:49 EST 2009
#     Die if we can't cd to a build directory.
#     Use make option flags on Mesa's build.
#     Document that Exodus requires NetCDF.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Feb 18 22:57:25 PST 2009
#     Updated Silo to version 4.7 and added to build_silo logic to use Qt
#     for silex. Installed some binaries for Mac OS
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 19 09:41:43 PST 2009
#     Added ability to specify alternate download paths for downloading files.
#     Set Silo functions to download silo from Silo's web site.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 19 12:31:20 PST 2009
#     Refactored the multiple places that downloads functions were implmeneted
#     to download_file/try_download_file. The former either trys known places
#     or loops over specified sites. The latter attempts a specific download.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 19 14:51:07 PST 2009
#     Fixed help message for --svn option. It DOES NOT assume HEAD and always
#     reads the revision argument.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar  5 13:46:15 PST 2009
#     Added this comment regarding recent changes that I neglected to comment
#     about. Added support for a dbio-only (DO_DBIO_ONLY) build. Added logic
#     in several places to disable stuff that is not needed for a dbio-only
#     build as well as enable all 3rd party database plugin libs.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar  5 16:33:45 PST 2009
#     I fixed problems that arose due to a bad commit.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Mar 11 14:24:36 PDT 2009
#     Fixed convenience logic for enabling ALL third party I/O libs for
#     dbio-only builds.
#
#     Patrick Shinpaugh, Wed Mar 11 11:38:55 MST 2009
#     Set flags + Mesa && Qt targets for ppc64 systems.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Mar 11 11:45:59 MST 2009
#     Incorporated a patch from Patrick Shinpaugh which fixes the BoxLib build
#     on Linux-ppc64.

#     (based on a patch from Patrick Shinpaugh).
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar 19 09:08:28 PDT 2009
#     Merged from RC. Added web path for fastbit.

#     Merged from RC.
#     Added ITAPS to graphical options for 3rd party libs. Updated HDF5 to
#     1.8.1 and added web-links for HDF5 and HDF4 and GDAL. Made download_file
#     fallback to getting from other sites if gets from svn/visit site fails.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Mar 17 21:15:53 MST 2009
#     Added a patch which sets the endianness properly on Linux-ppc systems
#     (based on a patch from Patrick Shinpaugh).
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sun Mar 22 15:34:39 MST 2009
#     Fix CCMIO builds on Linux-PPC. -- thanks to Patrick Shinpaugh.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sun Mar 22 20:00:46 MST 2009
#     Correct an earlier patch I had made to PPC HDF4 -- thanks P.S.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Mon Mar 23 17:09:00 PDT 2009
#     Added -DH5_USE_16_API to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS for the gdal build
#     so that it would build with hdf5 1.8.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Apr  7 14:56:44 PDT 2009
#     Added missing surrounding quotes in creation of DEFAULT_ITAPS_IMPLS
#     symbol for config.conf file that gets created.

#     of ITAPS_GRUMMP missing iMesh_protos.h
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Apr  8 11:48:04 PDT 2009
#     Removed shared libs from ITAPS installs to make it easier to package
#     the build up using visit-bin-dist.
