# *****************************************************************************
#   Script: build_visit
#
#   Purpose:
#       A script that performs a complete build of VisIt and its support
#       libraries.  The script will detect if support libraries have already
#       been built and, if so, use those pre-built libraries.
#
#   Warning:
#       This script is only expected to work for Linux, and Darwin systems.
#       If you need to build VisIt for another platform, you should consult
#       the BUILD_NOTES that come with the VisIt source.  That document
#       contains instructions on how to build VisIt and its third party
#       libraries.
#
#   This script has been tested and is known to work with the following OS/
#   compiler combinations:
#
#	OS	Hardware	Compiler	Machine
#	-----	--------	--------	-------
#       RHEL3,	x86,		GCC 3.4.6	staples.llnl.gov
#       RHEL3, 	x86,		GCC 3.2.3	hoth.llnl.gov
#       CHAOS, 	x86_64,		GCC 3.4.5	vertex.llnl.gov
#       CHAOS,	ia64, 		GCC 3.4.5	thunder.llnl.gov
#       SuSE,   x86_64,		GCC 4.0.2	antares.lbl.gov
#       SuSE,   x86_64,		GCC 4.1.0	octagon.lbl.gov
#       MacOSX  i386,		GCC 4.0.1	tread.llnl.gov
#       MacOSX  ppc,		GCC 4.0.1	snailbait.llnl.gov
#
#   It is believed that this script will also work with other Linux variations.
#   Please send feedback to visit-users@ornl.gov if you run into problems 
#   so that this script can be improved in the future.  If you have built
#   VisIt using this script on an OS/hardware/compiler combination not listed
#   above, please send a note to visit-users@ornl.gov, so we can add that
#   information to the script.
#
#   Setup:
#       This script assumes you have downloaded the VisIt source code and 
#       the necessary third party libraries and that they are placed in the
#       current directory.  If it does not locate these libraries, it will
#       try to download them.
#       You must have:
#          Qt		qt-x11-free-3.3.8.tar.gz
#                    or qt-mac-free-3.3.8.tar.gz (Mac)
#          Mesa         MesaLib-6.4.2.tar.gz
#                    or Mesa-5.0-mangled.tar.gz (Linux)
#          Python	Python-2.5.tgz
#          VTK		vtk-5.0.0c.tar.gz
#          CMake	cmake-2.4.5.tar.gz
#          Silo		silo-4.6.1.tar.gz
#
#        The following optional libraries need to be in the current directory
#        to be built. You must explicitly select which option library to
#        build, either through run string options or the dialog gui. If
#        the tarballs don't exist they will not be built or downloaded

#     to make sure third party libraries are there.  (2) construction of
#     "visit-arch" string involved undefined variable, which caused problems
#     on some platforms.

#     
#     Hank Childs, Mon Sep 10 12:33:06 PDT 2007

#     download Qt, VTK, Mesa, VisIt source, etc.
#
#     Hank Childs, Thu Sep 13 06:15:07 PDT 2007
#     If you are building Exodus, then build NetCDF too.  Otherwise the build
#     will fail.  Also, install Exodus using relative paths for its symlinks.

#     supported on MacOS X 10.5 and will not build, so use a 10.4 
#     (or earlier) built version of Qt and install it in
#     $VISITDIR/qt/${QT_VERSION}/$VISITARCH
#
#     Hank Childs, Thu Nov 15 09:14:58 PST 2007

#     Fixed bug for setting the default values for parallel build flag.

#     g++ during the build process.

#     Implemented the above.

#     Modified the logic that splits the output of "mpiCC -show" into
#     parallel linker and compiler flags to select any strings that start
#     with "-L", "-l" and "-Wl" as linker flags, any strings that start
#     with "-I" and "-D" as compiler flags, and any remaining strings that
#     start with "-" as both compiler and linker flags.
