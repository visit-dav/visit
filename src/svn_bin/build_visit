# *****************************************************************************
#   Script: build_visit
#
#   Purpose:
#       A script that performs a complete build of VisIt and its support
#       libraries.  The script will detect if support libraries have already
#       been built and, if so, use those pre-built libraries.
#
#   Warning:
#       This script is only expected to work for Linux, and Darwin systems.
#       If you need to build VisIt for another platform, you should consult
#       the BUILD_NOTES that come with the VisIt source.  That document
#       contains instructions on how to build VisIt and its third party
#       libraries.
#
#   This script has been tested and is known to work with the following OS/
#   compiler combinations:
#
#	OS	Hardware	Compiler	Machine
#	-----	--------	--------	-------
#       RHEL3,	x86,		GCC 3.4.6	staples.llnl.gov
#       RHEL3, 	x86,		GCC 3.2.3	hoth.llnl.gov
#       CHAOS, 	x86_64,		GCC 3.4.5	vertex.llnl.gov
#       CHAOS,	ia64, 		GCC 3.4.5	thunder.llnl.gov
#       SuSE,   x86_64,		GCC 4.0.2	antares.lbl.gov
#       SuSE,   x86_64,		GCC 4.1.0	octagon.lbl.gov
#       MacOSX  i386,		GCC 4.0.1	dantooine.llnl.gov
#       MacOSX  ppc,		GCC 4.0.1	snailbait.llnl.gov
#
#   It is believed that this script will also work with other Linux variations.
#   Please send feedback to visit-users@ornl.gov if you run into problems 
#   so that this script can be improved in the future.  If you have built
#   VisIt using this script on an OS/hardware/compiler combination not listed
#   above, please send a note to visit-users@ornl.gov, so we can add that
#   information to the script.
#
#   Setup:
#       This script assumes you have downloaded the VisIt source code and 
#       the necessary third party libraries and that they are placed in the
#       current directory.  If it does not locate these libraries, it will
#       try to download them.
#       You must have:
#          Qt		qt-x11-opensource-4.4.3.tar.gz
#                    or qt-mac-opensource-4.4.3.tar.gz (Mac)
#          Mesa         MesaLib-7.5.tar.gz
#          Python	Python-2.5.tgz
#          VTK		vtk-5.0.0d.tar.gz
#          CMake	cmake-2.6.4.tar.gz
#
#        The following optional libraries need to be in the current directory
#        to be built. You must explicitly select which option library to
#        build, either through run string options or the dialog gui. If
#        the tarballs don't exist they will not be built or downloaded
#           Library  Version  Source Tarball Name    Command Option

#     Make szip build on FC9.  (szip is required for HDF5.)
#
#     Hank Childs, Mon Sep  1 09:21:27 PDT 2008
#     Move all patches to their own function.  (Purpose is to improve
#     readability and maintainability.)
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Oct  2 22:03:56 MDT 2008
#     Move PIL out of build_python into its own function.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Fri Oct  3 11:01:28 MDT 2008
#     Fix the PIL download URL, and add a dir variable.
#     Added a set of functions for ease of use.
#     Cleaned up the PIL build function, and don't redirect the function so it
#     can easily use the new functions to log information.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Oct  6 23:11:17 MDT 2008
#     Force -fPIC in BoxLib for non-AIX.  Switch fortran to compiler to
#     `gfortran' if `g77' is not found.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Oct  9 16:11:56 MDT 2008
#     Long options and parsing.
#     Updated 'usage' message to account for long options, and greatly
#     improved the formatting.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Fri Oct 10 11:20:24 MDT 2008
#     Removed an embarassing oversight leftover from debugging my
#     earlier work on the PIL.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Tue Oct 14 11:23:14 PDT 2008
#     Changed the version to 1.11.0.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct 21 10:32:36 PDT 2008
#     Modified to support VisIt's configure new way of handling hdf5.
#     Modified to support shared hdf5.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Oct 22 09:05:43 MDT 2008
#     Add an --szip command line to enable SZip.  Don't force SZip if the user
#     wants HDF5, but enable SZip if they ask for it.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Oct 28 11:14:17 PDT 2008
#     Modified build of H5Part to use -DH5_USE_16_API. See notes in that func.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Mon Nov 17 22:30:28 PST 2008
#     Made Silo optional instead of required; removed Silo patching; upgraded
#     Silo version to 4.6.2. Copied the pattern used for CCMIO.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Nov 20 10:03:12 PST 2008
#     Fixed typo in DEFAULT_SILO symbols put in generated config-site file.
#     Updated DEFAULT_SILO symbols to use LIBLOC/LIBDEP form.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Nov 18 16:34:49 PST 2008
#     Changes for Qt4 including:
#      *Added build_qt4 (doesn't currently download the src tarball however)
#      *Replaced the repeated "check for dir + try to unzip + try to untar" 
#        chunk of code with new function: prepare_build_dir
#      *Changed all build dirs vars to name [NAME]_BUILD_DIR, instead of 
#        [NAME]_DIR.In some cases [NAME]_DIR caused problems and was previously 
#        fixed with a special name BV_[NAME]_DIR, I just made everything 
#        uniform.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Dec  2 13:44:29 PST 2008
#     Stopped creating symlink of szip static lib in hdf5 install.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sat Dec  6 21:27:55 PST 2008
#     A silo path variable was missing "silo".
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Dec  8 22:46:17 MST 2008
#     Quoted compiler flags given to VTK.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Dec 11 08:38:41 PST 2008
#     Made the auto-generated config-site file a little more portable by
#     creating a VISITARCH variable in the file and using \$VISITARCH
#     everywhere to refer to that variable in the config-site file and not
#     the shell variable defined in build_visit.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Thu Dec 11 16:02:54 EST 2008
#     Modified the variables in the auto-generated config-site file for
#     Silo-HDF5 dependency.
#
#     Hank Childs, Fri Dec 12 09:11:07 PST 2008
#     Added support for Ice-T.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Fri Dec 12 14:14:55 PST 2008
#     Fixed problem with checking if cgns is already built/installed.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Fri Dec 12 14:14:55 PST 2008
#     Changed version of google-perftools to 0.97 (from 0.98). 
#     0.97 is the version already in our repo and I verified it was the 
#     version Hank integrated into VisIt. 
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Dec 15 16:21:47 MST 2008
#     Cleanups for the IceT macro: handle multiple options in PAR_INCLUDE,
#     enable verbose makefiles so debugging IceT issues is possible, and
#     install IceT instead of copying libraries manually.
#
#     Hank Childs, Mon Jan 26 15:57:02 PST 2009
#     Add support for FastBit.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jan 29 13:24:34 EST 2009
#     Fixing Mesa 6.4.2 patching.  (This is already fixed on the 2.0 branch?)
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sat Feb  7 15:40:49 EST 2009
#     Die if we can't cd to a build directory.
#     Use make option flags on Mesa's build.
#     Document that Exodus requires NetCDF.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Feb 18 22:57:25 PST 2009
#     Updated Silo to version 4.7 and added to build_silo logic to use Qt
#     for silex. Installed some binaries for Mac OS
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 19 09:41:43 PST 2009
#     Added ability to specify alternate download paths for downloading files.
#     Set Silo functions to download silo from Silo's web site.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 19 12:31:20 PST 2009
#     Refactored the multiple places that downloads functions were implmeneted
#     to download_file/try_download_file. The former either trys known places
#     or loops over specified sites. The latter attempts a specific download.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Feb 19 14:51:07 PST 2009
#     Fixed help message for --svn option. It DOES NOT assume HEAD and always
#     reads the revision argument.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar  5 13:46:15 PST 2009
#     Added this comment regarding recent changes that I neglected to comment
#     about. Added support for a dbio-only (DO_DBIO_ONLY) build. Added logic
#     in several places to disable stuff that is not needed for a dbio-only
#     build as well as enable all 3rd party database plugin libs.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar  5 16:33:45 PST 2009
#     I fixed problems that arose due to a bad commit.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Mar 11 14:24:36 PDT 2009
#     Fixed convenience logic for enabling ALL third party I/O libs for
#     dbio-only builds.
#
#     Patrick Shinpaugh, Wed Mar 11 11:38:55 MST 2009
#     Set flags + Mesa && Qt targets for ppc64 systems.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Mar 11 11:45:59 MST 2009
#     Incorporated a patch from Patrick Shinpaugh which fixes the BoxLib build
#     on Linux-ppc64.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Mar 11 11:52:09 MST 2009
#     Incorporated a patch from Patrick which fixes the Linux-ppc64 HDF4 build.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar 12 00:24:18 PDT 2009
#     Eliminated Qt dependence for dbio-only builds.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Mar 17 21:15:53 MST 2009
#     Added a patch which sets the endianness properly on Linux-ppc systems
#     (based on a patch from Patrick Shinpaugh).
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar 19 09:08:28 PDT 2009
#     Merged from RC. Added web path for fastbit.
#     Fixed cut-n-paste typos in error messages from ITAPS configures.
#     Set VisIt version number to 2.0.0
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Thu Mar 19 09:39:41 PDT 2009
#     Merged from RC.
#     Added ITAPS to graphical options for 3rd party libs. Updated HDF5 to
#     1.8.1 and added web-links for HDF5 and HDF4 and GDAL. Made download_file
#     fallback to getting from other sites if gets from svn/visit site fails.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Mar 17 21:15:53 MST 2009
#     Added a patch which sets the endianness properly on Linux-ppc systems
#     (based on a patch from Patrick Shinpaugh).
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sun Mar 22 15:34:39 MST 2009
#     Fix CCMIO builds on Linux-PPC. -- thanks to Patrick Shinpaugh.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sun Mar 22 20:00:46 MST 2009
#     Correct an earlier patch I had made to PPC HDF4 -- thanks P.S.
#
#     Eric Brugger, Mon Mar 23 17:09:00 PDT 2009
#     Added -DH5_USE_16_API to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS for the gdal build
#     so that it would build with hdf5 1.8.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Apr  7 14:56:44 PDT 2009
#     Added missing surrounding quotes in creation of DEFAULT_ITAPS_IMPLS
#     symbol for config.conf file that gets created.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Apr  7 15:02:19 PDT 2009
#     Added missing path component for include path for ITAPS_FMDB symbol.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Apr  8 10:25:38 PDT 2009
#     Fixed some problems with _IMPL symbol for ITAPS_GRUMMP. Fixed install
#     of ITAPS_GRUMMP missing iMesh_protos.h
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Apr  8 11:48:04 PDT 2009
#     Removed shared libs from ITAPS installs to make it easier to package
#     the build up using visit-bin-dist.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Apr 21 14:38:20 PDT 2009
#     Updated to newest ITAPS implementations. Changed places where the string
#     'build_visit' is explicilty used in 3-4 places with $0. That allows
#     this script to be re-named (such as for ITAPS' iMeshIO tool) and things
#     still make some sense. Changed configuration for build_grummp to use
#     --enable-itaps instead of --enable-imesh --enable-ibase. Added a wee bit
#     of logic to rename visitconvert tools in case we're using this script
#     to build iMeshIO. 
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Thu May  7 11:20:50 PDT 2009
#     Update H5Part to 1.4.2 and FastBit to 1.0.8 as required by changes
#     to the HDF_UC database plugin. Download FastBit automatically from
#     LBNL Codeforge if TAR ball not present.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Thu May 14 15:56:44 EDT 2009
#     HDF5 seemed to be updated to 1.8.2 in some places, but others were
#     left as 1.8.1 or 1.6.5.  I updated *all* references to be to 1.8.2.
#     At the very least, this fixed ftp downloading of HDF5.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Sat May 16 14:47:05 MDT 2009
#     Enhanced downloadv to check subversion.
#     Update NetCDF version to workaround compilation issues.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed May 20 11:14:15 PDT 2009
#     Removed all refs to functions 'webget' and 'downloadv'. Those were
#     made obsolete following changes of Feb 19, 2009. Adjusted some text
#     were explicit refs to 'VisIt Build Process' or 'VisIt' were used to
#     use DLG_BACKTITLE and/or DLG_PKGNAME to make this script less
#     confusing when being used to install visit-related capabilities but
#     named differently (e.g. iMeshIO for ITAPS project).
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed May 20 11:40:55 PDT 2009
#     Fixed typo in NETCDF_BUILD_DIR name. It was missing '_BUILD'.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon May 25 15:42:30 MDT 2009
#     Fixed NetCDF downloading (mirror was missing).
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Jun 10 16:19:38 MDT 2009
#     Update Mesa to 7.5.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Mon Jun 22 13:56:05 PDT 2009
#     Removed dup ON_SILO/DO_SILO lines.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Mon Jun 22 21:54:25 PDT 2009
#     Adjusted _VERSION/_FILE/_BUILD_DIR symbols for FastBit, H5Part, HDF5
#     and Silo so that you don't have upteen different places to edit the
#     version number, they are consistent with other lib symbols and they
#     are correct and up to date.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Jun 24 15:40:59 PDT 2009
#     Fixed missing opening double quote for call to info in build_silo.
#
#     Hank Childs, Tue Jul 14 15:32:09 PDT 2009
#     Fix problem where .conf file is setting up CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS improperly.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Jul 23 15:52:24 MDT 2009
#     Make sure the user knows why we couldn't use the dialog interface.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Jul 30 19:20:29 MDT 2009
#     Unset CDPATH to make sure we don't inherit a bad setting.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Aug  4 11:24:29 MDT 2009
#     Make VTK link against mangled Mesa.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Aug  4 13:24:24 PDT 2009
#     Changed MESA_MIRRORS to MESA_URL to make consistent with other symbols.
#     Added $MESA_URL to ensure_built_or_ready invokation. I also made it
#     possible to specify value for VISITDIR external to script so you can
#     essentially tell build_visit where to install its libs to.
# 
#     Cyrus Harrison,  Tue Aug  4 16:06:20 PDT 2009
#     Fixed a typo w/ MESA_URL - it was providing the full path for the sourceforge
#     download, and because of this build_visit was putting the tarball in the path twice.
#
#     Brad Whitlock, Mon Aug 17 12:49:11 PDT 2009
#     Use the regular build path for NetCDF on Darwin but fixup the library
#     names after installation. Don't always assume szip for hdf5 on Darwin.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Mon Aug 17 14:08:38 PDT 2009
#     Added BUILD_VISIT_ENV to facilitate correct behavior of top-level
#     Makefile's env-make var collision check when it is being run from within
#     build_visit.
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Thu Sep  3 10:14:33 PDT 2009
#     Change install name for Qt 4 on Darwin so that TAR-balls created with
#     visit-bin-dist work on other machines. Added comments for necessary changes
#     to switch to Qt 4.5.
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Tue Sep 15 11:35:19 PDT 2009
#     Only use first two components of gcc version in architecture string
#     since the "least significant" portion of the version number can
#     be changed by gcc maintenance updates (at least on Ubuntu) and these
#     updated maintain binary compatibility.
#
#     Brad Whitlock, Mon Sep 21 09:53:56 PDT 2009
#     Adding support for AdvIO
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Thu Oct 15 08:42:01 PDT 2009
#     Modifications to build_mesa & its patches to support building on AIX.
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Fri Oct 23 13:17:34 PDT 2009
#     Specify explicit path to system curl so that we do not use another
#     version without SSL support
#     Support for build on Snow Leopard
#
#     Jed Brown, Sat Oct 24 21:57:05 CEST 2009
#     Do not build QtSql components (they are not used and broke gcc-4.4.1/qt-4.4.3)
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Fri Oct 30 14:19:57 PDT 2009
#     Yet another Python fix: Use compatibility version in host.conf file instead
#     of version.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Nov  3 16:43:53 PST 2009
#     Use of vtk-5.0.0d & transition to a "make install"ed vtk
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Nov  3 16:43:53 PST 2009
#     Added support for using VisIt's anonymous svn server via "--svn-anonymous"
#     Switched all versions of OSX to use Python 2.6.4 by default.
#
#     Hank Childs, Tue Nov 10 08:21:19 PST 2009
#     Add support for "build_visit --no-thirdparty --vtk".  This was a
#     supported option before, but it failed to properly download and/or build 
#     Mesa, CMake, and Python.
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Tue Nov 10 19:46:08 PST 2009
#     Change install_name for VTK on MacOS.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Nov 17 12:33:47 PST 2009
#     Reverted back to custom creation of python shared library on AIX.
#     Changed SO_EXT for AIX to ".a"
#
#     Hank Childs, Mon Nov 23 07:59:36 PST 2009
#     Add parallel include to CFLAGS.
#
#     Hank Childs, Wed Nov 25 11:43:31 PST 2009
#     Add some defense against using existing "VTK" directory from 5.0.0c.
#     Quote the PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS.  Remove CMakeCache.txt file.  Change
#     the log file to be in the current directory.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Thu Dec 10 09:13:40 PST 2009
#     Added rpath linker flags when python is built using gcc.
#     This is necessary b/c python's build system does not build an exe that
#     runs without setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH if a non standard prefix is used.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Mon Dec 21 12:42:52 EST 2009
#     Removed one final use of .conf, changed to .cmake.
#     Fixed a few bugs in the way the host .cmake file is generated.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Mon Dec 21 15:05:42 MST 2009
#     Fix Mesa libraries used when building VTK.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Dec 22 14:20:51 MST 2009
#     Revert above change, at least on Linux.
#     Add missing CMake type specifier.
#
#     Cyrus Harrison, Tue Dec 29 14:07:52 PST 2009
#     Removed stray instance of $VISITDIR & changed hostconf generator to use
#     ITAPS_FILE_PATTERNS  instead of ITAPS_FILE_EXTENSIONS to match
#     Jeremy's change to db plugins.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Jan  5 19:44:21 MST 2010
#     Linux: Switch mangled Mesa and OSMesa library settings.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Jan  6 18:53:08 MST 2010
#     Add -pthread to python link flags.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Tue Jan 12 20:32:14 MST 2010
#     Don't build some Qt subsystems that we don't need.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Jan 13 14:05:59 MST 2010
#     Fix the above change; only changed what *printed* before!
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Jan 13 19:53:25 MST 2010
#     Get rid of OpenSSL too; we're not using QtNetwork.
#
#     Brad Whitlock, Thu Jan 28 10:16:29 PST 2010
#     Added some small changes for MacOS X 10.4
#
#     Tom Fogal, Wed Jan 20 22:58:41 MST 2010
#     Re-add QtXml to the list of Mac frameworks.
#
#     Tom Fogal, Thu Jan 21 20:27:37 MST 2010
#     Re-add OpenSSL, it's used directly (not through QtNetwork!).
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jan 28 10:23:10 EST 2010
#     Changed VISIT_EXODUS_DIR in .cmake generation to EXODUSII, to
#     match what the build system expects.
#
#     Jeremy Meredith, Thu Jan 28 17:47:24 EST 2010
#     Couple changes for OS X 10.4: don't pass rpath to python since the
#     linker doesn't understand it (python filters are disabled for 10.4),
#     and don't pass the compatibility/current version flags to libtool
#     since VTK/CMake seems to be setting them appropriately on its own.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Tue Feb  2 11:20:33 PST 2010
#     Updated Silo to 4.7.2 and HDF5 to 1.8.4. Also fixed a problem where the
#     hostconf file was specifying a relative path for the first line for
#     cmake. Configure didn't like that.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Feb  3 10:36:05 PST 2010
#     Added -no-libtiff to qt build.
#
#     Brad Whitlock Wed Feb 3 10:00:36 PDT 2010
#     I added Jean Favre's VISIT_STATIC patch.
#
#     Mark C. Miller, Wed Feb  3 11:00:11 PST 2010
#     Averted breaking --thirdparty-path by changing logic that includes
#     cmake path in hostconf file to compute absolute path from
#     $THIRD_PARTY_PATH
#
#     Hank Childs, Thu Feb  4 08:21:27 PST 2010
#     Add argument --svn-revision.
#
#     Brad Whitlock, Wed Feb 10 23:35:34 PST 2010
#     Added a patch for Boxlib and upgraded GDAL to get them working on
#     Ubuntu 9.10.
#
#     Gunther H. Weber, Tue Feb 16 11:07:08 PST 2010
#     Adapted to new H5Part
#
#     Hank Childs and Paul Navratil, Sat Feb 20 17:31:54 CST 2010
#     Fix for building Ice-T when PAR_INCLUDE has a -DDEFINE first.
