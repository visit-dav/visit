// Class: StatusSubject
//
// Purpose:
//   This struct contains attributes that describe a message to put
//   on the main window's statusbar.
//
// Notes:      
//   It's a Subject instead of an AttributeSubject because I don't
//   care about partial selection and it does not go across the network.
